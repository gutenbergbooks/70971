<h2 class="nobreak" ><em>PAUL CLAUDEL</em></h2>
</div>

<p class="center big1"><em>BY PIERRE CHAVANNES</em></p>

<p class="center"><em>Reprinted from “The New Statesman,” London, by the<br>
courtesy of the Editor</em></p>


<p class="p2"><em>Claudel worked for more than twenty years
in silence in an almost complete obscurity.
Nobody ever mentioned him save a few very independent
artists—Mirbeau, Barrès, Schwob, Gide,
Jammes, Mauclair—who talked about him amongst
themselves and sometimes even dared to speak about
him in public, without awakening an echo.</em></p>

<p><em>Moreover, Claudel was usually far from France,
Consul in various towns of the Far East; he published
his earlier works anonymously, lest their Catholic
character should damage his career, and for a long
time his work was only to be seen in the small literary
reviews and in special editions, of which a very small
number of copies were printed; and he never attempted
to advertise himself. But in time he was saddened by
this great solitude. “One grows tired,” he wrote, “of
speaking, as it were, in impenetrable cotton-wool.”</em></p>

<p><em>These latter days Claudel’s glory, which had so long
been obscured, has suddenly blazed forth, if not to the
great public, at least to the public which reads and is
interested in literature. The Théâtre de l’Œuvre
has played one of his dramas</em>—L’Annonce faite à
Marie; <em>the Théâtre du Vieux Colombier is about to
play another</em>—L’Échange. <em>The ordinary newspaper
critics have begun talking about Claudel; generally
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</span>
speaking, they refer to him with admiration,
often with astonishment and that kind of reserve which
marks men who are not sure that they understand, and,
fearing that they are deceiving themselves, do not wish
completely to commit themselves. But in many young
reviews admiration is carried to a pitch of enthusiasm
and almost of worship; and today writers who are by
no means young rank Claudel with the small company
of the very great: Æschylus, Dante, Shakespeare,
Goethe.</em></p>

<p><em>Reading Claudel, one can understand this long
silence, this admiration, and also this reserve. Claudel
is not an easy poet: when one penetrates his work
one is transported as though into a foreign country.
He has a speech peculiar to himself; he has invented
a form which is neither prose, nor regular verse, nor
ordinary</em> vers libre; <em>his work, created by a solitary
man, is not bound up with our troubles and our daily
life; to love Claudel one must be initiated.</em></p>

<p><em>He is a poet, in itself a thing rare in our time; but
he is also, and some would say primarily, a thinker.
He has brought his dramatic work together under the
general title of</em> L’Arbre, <em>just as Balzac assembled his
immense work under the title of</em> La Comédie Humaine.
<em>By this title Claudel wants to indicate that his work has
the sort of natural profound living unity of the tree,
which thrusts its roots deep into the nourishing earth,
and draws from it the sap which rises in the branches
to feed the remotest sunlit boughs. Each of his dramas
also is a drama of thought; they raise the greatest problems
and often suggest solutions. Tête d’Or is the chief,
the commander of men, the conqueror, who is driven
to great deeds by an immense desire—as it were, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</span>
predestination. The weak, whom Cébès symbolizes,
the people, give themselves to him; he carries them in
his train until the day when, undertaking an enterprise
beyond mortal strength, he loses his power and
dies a new Prometheus on a high mountain.</em> La Ville
<em>presents contemporary society and the struggles that
rend it, and the great attitudes of the spirit confronting
life: Isidore de Besme, the engineer, the savant, is the
realist, who has a knowledge of natural forces and uses
them to satisfy the needs of men. He dominates the
town, but he is unaware of the mystic quality of things;
he wrongly estimates the soul, and his science leads
only to death. Lambert is the man who seeks the end
of life in the play of ideas and the love of woman.
Cœuvre, finally, is the poet who enters the inmost
shrine of truth by intuition and love, but is condemned
to solitude by that knowledge.</em> Le Repos du Septième
Jour <em>is an ideologic drama: a Chinese Emperor goes
down into hell, and the roots of the moral world are
laid bare in a Dantesque vision, a kind of summary
of good and evil.</em> L’Échange <em>and</em> La Jeune Fille
Violaine <em>are dramas of sentiment. In</em> L’Échange
<em>four characters are set against the brutal, realistic,
material background of America. There is Louis
Laine, an adventurous, but feeble, person who had
stifled in the too rigid enclosure of the old European
society; there is his wife, the gentle Marthe, the wife
faithful through everything, who keeps close in her
heart the traditional virtues of the old Christian world;
there is Lechy, the violent woman who is the incarnation
of disorder, and spreads it around her and death with
it; and there is Sir Pollock, the man of affairs, who
only lives for gold, convinced that anything can be bought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</span>
with it, and demands Louis Laine’s wife from him for
a fistful of money.</em> La Jeune Fille Violaine <em>is the
sublime poem of a holy soul which enriches itself by
stripping itself, and arrives through suffering and renunciation
to peace and the joy of an angelic death.
In</em> L’Otage, <em>we have the eternal story of a conflict
between that which remains and that which passes</em>.</p>

<p><em>It is impossible in a brief space to analyze dramas
so laden with ideas, but one can indicate the size and
the unity of the work. The tree that Claudel wants to
show us is the tree of life. The roots are in</em> Le Repos
du Septième Jour; <em>the sap, the desire, in</em> Tête d’Or;
<em>the double-branching—the ideas of the mind in</em> La
Ville, <em>and sentiment in</em> L’Échange, La Jeune Fille
Violaine, <em>and</em> L’Otage. <em>Claudel himself has formulated
the theory and doctrine of his art in three treatises
brought together in his</em> Art Poetique.</p>

<p><em>It might be imagined that Claudel was a mere man
of books, a thinker in the abstract. He is nothing of the
sort. This thinker is at the same time the most concrete
of poets. His thought is, as it were, swollen with
essential sap. And he expresses it in a flow of images
taken directly from things and exhibiting them in their
reality. Claudel’s originality lies in this double aspect:
the unique blend of the highest intellectuality with the
richest realism. The man who meditates over the greatest
problems and expounds a profound logical doctrine
to justify his work is at the same time a primitive
who works with his fresh and eager eyes fixed on Nature.
His dramas never lose touch with the earth where men
live, love, and suffer. His characters are greater than
Nature, and they express themselves quite naturally
with a biblical amplitude; but they never ring false<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</span>
and they often move us deeply. For they are powerfully
real types which exist and which one often remembers.
These two elements do not always mingle in a perfect
harmony; Claudel’s art is powerful, but it is not easy:
it is like the obscure and painful work of germination.
His admirers themselves say that Claudel’s works are
like symphonies that one must hear several times before
grasping their meaning and their beauties, and that
his plays are beyond the capacity of the present-day
public.</em></p>

<p><em>Claudel is, finally, one must admit, a great religious
poet, and it is in that fact that the deepest unity of his
work must be sought. His work, it has been said,
is a long pilgrimage towards God; and the road has not
been without its grievous strugglings, since the day when
in his youth he was suddenly converted and flung
himself towards God, but without winning light for his
reason. “O my God,” he cries years after:</em></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>I remember the darkness where we two were face to face, those
gloomy winter afternoons in Notre-Dame.</em></p>

<p><em>I, all alone below there, lit up the face of the great bronze
Christ with a twopenny-halfpenny taper.</em></p>

<p><em>All men were then against us, science and reason; and I replied
nothing.</em></p>

<p><em>Only the faith was in me, and I looked at You in silence like
a man who prefers his friend.</em></p>

<p><em>I went down into Your sepulcher with You.</em></p>
</div>

<p><em>Claudel’s whole life has been a struggle for the faith,
for he is one of those men for whom there is no life save
in God, and who see nothing outside faith in Him save
despair, death, and annihilation. A somber sadness
burdens those first dramas which tell of man’s great
struggle to dispense with God and his check; but this
gives way to joy in proportion as Claudel’s faith<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</span>
strengthens and grow bright. That pilgrimage towards
God is also a pilgrimage towards joy; and that joy
breaks into great song, now austere, now delirious, in
Claudel’s properly lyrical work—the</em> Hymnes <em>and
the</em> Cinq Grandes Odes. <em>Here one hears only the most
distant echoes of the great struggle; here are only cries
of joy and certitude.</em></p>

<p>
<em>Blessed be Thou, my God, Who hast delivered me from death....
... He who believes not in God, believes not in Being, and he<br>
Who hates being, hates his own existence.<br>
Lord, I have found Thee.<br>
Who finds Thee has no more tolerance of death.</em><br>
</p>

<p><em>A strange phenomenon, this Christian poet, passionately,
uncompromisingly, almost fanatically Catholic,
in the country where Anatole France, the bantering
and disillusioned master, holds sway, where Renan
and Voltaire reigned, and with them hard reason,
distrustful of the supernatural.</em></p>

<p><em>France, as Kipling has justly said, is the country
most faithful to old things and most wildly enthusiastic
about new ones. The present fashion for Roman
Catholicism counts for something in Claudel’s sudden
vogue, just as Claudel has done something to bring
about the fashion. Various writers, tired of wandering
far from safe harbors, have “been converted” by Claudel’s
appeal; and the young men who reproached France
for withering life up, and for lacking the “sense of the
divine” have found in Claudel one of their masters.
It is the perpetual oscillation of the human spirit
from pure reason to exalted sentiment. Claudel stands
head and shoulders above the little crowd which surrounds
him, and he will outlast them and their ways of
thought. Most of us must say to him, in the words of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</span>
one of his own characters, “I cannot give you my soul.”
But we love the poet in him and admire the passionate
believer who compels us to question ourselves in the
inner silence, the man who made for himself this
prayer:</em></p>

<p>
<em>Make me as one who sows solitude, and may he who hears my speech<br>
Return home troubled and heavy.</em><br>

</div>

<h2 class="nobreak" >THE COCOA PALM</h2>


<p>Our trees stand upright like men, but
motionless; thrusting their roots deep
in earth, they flourish with outstretched
arms. But here the sacred banyan does
not rise as a single stem; for the pendent
threads, through which it returns seeking
the fruitful soil, make it seem a marvelous
temple self-created.</p>

<p>Observe only the cocoa palm. It has no
branches. At the apex of the trunk it
raises a tuft of fronds.</p>

<p>Palm! The insignia of triumph. Aerial
in the light, consummate bloom of the crest,
it soars, expands, rejoices,—and sinks
beneath the weight of its freedom.</p>

<p>Through the warm day and the long
noon the cocoa palm expands. In an
ecstasy it spreads its happy leaves. Like
infant heads the cocoanuts appear, the
great green fruit of the tree.</p>

<p>Thus does the cocoa palm gesture, revealing
its heart; for the lower leaves,
unfolding from out their depth, reach<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
pendulent to the earth; and the leaves
in the midst spread far on every side; and
the leaves above, uplifted like the hands of
an awkward man or like one who signals
his complete submission, slowly wave and
sign.</p>

<p>The trunk is nowhere rigid, but ringed;
and like to the blades of the grass, it is
supple and long. It is swayed by the
moods of the earth, whether it strains
toward the sun or bends its spreading
plumes over swift and turbid rivers, or
between the sea and the sky.</p>

<p>One night, returning along the shore of
the sea assaulted with turbulent foam by
the whole deep-thundering weight of the
leonine Indian Ocean beneath the south-western
monsoon,—as I followed the shore
far-strewn with palms like the skeleton
wrecks of boats and of lesser and living
things, I saw them upon my left! As I
walked by that forest empty beneath its
dense-woven ceiling, the palms seemed
enormous spiders crawling obliquely across
the peaceful twilight heaven!</p>

<p>Venus, like a moon drowned in divinest
light, flickered a wide reflection in the
waters. And a palm-tree bent over the
sea and the mirrored planet, and its gesture
offered its heart to the heavenly fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span></p>

<p>I shall often remember that night when,
afar, I yearn to return! I saw the leafage
hanging in heavy tresses, and across the
high fane of the forest, that sky where the
storm, setting its feet on the sea, loomed
up like a mountain; and how low on the
dark horizon the pale pearl of the ocean
gleamed!</p>

<p>Oh Ceylon, shall I ever forget thee,—thy
fruits and thy flowers, and thy people
with melting eyes, naked beside those highways
that are hued like the mango’s flesh;
and my rickshaw-man’s gift of nodding
rosy flowers which he placed on my knees
when, with tears in my eyes, crushed down
by sorrow—but nibbling a leaf of cinnamon—I
left thee at last beneath thy
rainy skies.</p>



<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" >THE PAGODA</h2>
</div>


<p>I descend from my carriage, and the
sight of a hideous beggar marks the
beginning of my journey. With one bloodshot
eye he leers at me, and with a leprous
lip reveals to their roots teeth bone-yellow
and as long as those of a rabbit. The rest
of his face is eaten away.</p>

<p>Rows of other wretches are ranged on
both sides of the highway, which is thronged
at this outlet of the city with pedestrians,
messengers, and wheelbarrows bearing
women and their bundles. The oldest and
grossest of the men is called the King of
the Beggars. They say that, crazed by the
death of his mother, he carries her head
about with him concealed in his clothes.
The last that I notice, two very old women,
wrapped in swathings of rags, their faces
black from the dust of the roads where they
prostrate themselves at times, sing one of
those plaints broken with long sighs and
hiccoughs, which are the professional expressions
of despair among these outcasts.
I can see the pagoda afar off between
thickets of bamboo; and, crossing the fields,
I take a short cut toward it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span></p>

<p>The country is a vast cemetery. Everywhere
there are coffins; on hillocks covered
with withered reeds, and in the dry grass,
are rows of little stone posts, mitered statues,
or lions of stone, marking the ancient
sepulchers. Individual wealth or burial
associations have built these tombs surrounded
by trees and hedges. I pass
between a place for animals and a pit filled
with the skeletons of little girls whose
parents wished to be rid of them. They
have choked it to the mouth. It will soon
be necessary to dig another.</p>

<p>The day is warm, the sky clear, I walk
in the light of December.</p>

<p>The dogs see me, bark, and run away;
I reach and pass the villages with their black
roofs; I cross the fields of cotton and beans;
I cross the rivulets by the old worn bridges,
and, leaving on my right the great empty
buildings of a deserted powder-mill, I
arrive at my goal. I hear a noise of bells
and a drum.</p>

<p>Before me is a tower of seven stories.
An Indian with a golden turban, and
a Parsee wearing a plum-colored one
twisted like a stovepipe, are entering it.
Two other figures move about on the highest
balcony.</p>

<p>I must speak first of the pagoda itself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span></p>

<p>It is composed of three courts and three
temples, flanked by accessory chapels and
lesser buildings. Religion here does not,
as in Europe, barricade and segregate in
loneliness the mystery of a faith walled
about by dogma. Its function is not to
defend the absolute against exterior aspects.
It establishes a certain atmosphere; and,
as though suspended from heaven, the
structure gathers all nature into the offering
that it constitutes. Multifold, all upon
one level, it expresses Space by the relations
of height and distance between the
three arches of triumph or the temples
which are consecrated to them; and
Buddha, Prince of Peace, inhabits it with
all the gods.</p>

<p>Chinese architecture, as it were, suppresses
the walls. It amplifies and multiplies
the roofs; and their exaggerated
corners, lifting themselves with an exquisite
resilience, return toward the sky in flowing
curves. They remain suspended in air!
The wider and heavier the fabric of the roof,
the more, by that very weight, does it give
an impression of lightness through every
deep shadow projected below. Hence the
use of black tiles, that form deep grooves
and strong copings with high openings
between them, makes the highest ridges<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
detached and distinct. Clear though intricate
of outline, their frieze is lifted through
the lucid air. The temple is seen as a
portico, a canopy, or a tent, of which the
uplifted corners are attached to the clouds;
and in its shade are installed the idols of
the earth.</p>

<p>A fat, gilded fellow lives under the first
portico. His right foot, drawn beneath
him, indicates the third attitude of meditation,
where consciousness still exists.
His eyes are closed, but under his golden
skin can be seen the red lips of a distended
mouth whose long rounded opening stretches
at the corners into the shape of an eight.
He laughs, and the laugh is that of a face
asleep. At what does this obese ascetic
laugh? What does he see with those closed
eyes?</p>

<p>On each side of the hall, two at the right
and two at the left, the four painted and
varnished colossi, with short legs and enormous
torsos, are the demons who guard
the four shores of Heaven. Beardless as
children, one brandishes serpents, one plays
the viol, and one shakes a cylindrical
engine like a closed parasol or a firecracker.</p>

<p>I penetrate into the second court. A
great brass incense-burner covered with
inscriptions is in the middle. I stand before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
the principal pavilion. On the ridges
of the roof little painted groups of figures
seem as though they were passing from one
side to the other, or ascending while engaged
in conversation. At the angles of the
coping hang two pink fish, their long feelers
curving tremulously, their tails in the air;
in the center two dragons are fighting for
the mystic jewel. I hear songs and the
beating of bells, and through the open door
I see the evolutions of the bonzes.</p>

<p>The hall is high and spacious. Four or
five colossal gilded statues dominate the
background. The largest is seated on a
throne in the middle. His eyes and mouth
are closed, his feet drawn under him, and
one hand, held in the “gesture of witness,”
points to the earth. Thus, under the
sacred tree, the perfect Buddha conceived
himself. Escaped from the wheel of life,
he participates in his own Nirvana. Others
perched above him, with downcast eyes,
contemplate their navels. These are the
Heavenly Buddhas seated on lotus flowers.
They are Avalokhita, Amitabha, the Buddha
of the Light without Measure and
the Buddha of the Paradise of the West.
At their feet the bonzes pursue their
rites. They have gray robes; large, somewhat
rust-colored mantles attached to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
shoulder like togas; leggings of white linen;
and, some of them, a sort of mortar-board
on their heads. Others bare their scalps,
where the white marks of <em>moxas</em> show the
number of their vows. One by one, murmuring,
they file past. The last who
passes is a boy of twelve years. By a side
hall I reach the third court and see a third
temple.</p>

<p>Four priests perched on stools are ranged
inside the door. Their shoes are left on the
earth before them; and without the need
of feet, detached, imponderable, they are
seated on their own thoughts. They make
no movement. Their mouths, their closed
eyes, are one with the creases and wrinkles
in the wasted flesh of their faces, like the
scar of the navel. Consciousness of their
inertia is sufficient for their ruminating
intelligence. Under a niche in the middle
of the hall, I distinguish the shining limbs of
another Buddha. A confused company of
idols is ranged in the obscurity along the
walls.</p>

<p>Returning, I see the central temple from
the rear. High on the wall of an embrasure
a many-colored tympan represents some
legend among olive-trees. I re-enter. The
back of the repository where the colossi
are exposed is a great painted sculpture:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
Amitofou mounting to Heaven amid flames
and demons. The setting sun, passing
through the trellised openings high in the
wall, sweeps the somber boxlike hall with
horizontal rays.</p>

<p>The bonzes continue the ceremony.
Kneeling now before the colossi, they are
intoning a chant, while the celebrant,
standing before a bell shaped like a cask,
leads the measured beat of drums and bells.
At each verse he clashes the drum, drawing
from its brazen belly a re-echoing vibration.
Then, facing each other in two lines, they
recite some litany.</p>

<p>The side buildings are the dwellings of
the priests. One of them enters, carrying
a pail of water. I glance into the refectory
where the bowls of rice are placed two by
two on the empty tables.</p>

<p>I am again before the tower.</p>

<p>Just as the pagoda expresses, by its
system of courts and buildings, the extent
and the dimensions of Space; so the tower
symbolizes Height. Poised against the sky,
it becomes the scale of it. The seven
octagonal stories are a plan of the seven
mystic heavens. The architect has narrowed
their corners and lifted their borders
with skill. Each story casts its own shadow
below it. At every angle of every roof a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
bell is attached, and beside it hangs the
clapper with which to strike it. Their
metallic syllables are the mysterious voice
of each Heaven, and their unuttered sound
hangs suspended like a drop.</p>

<p>I have nothing more to say of the pagoda.
I do not know its name.</p>



<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" >THE CITY AT NIGHT</h2>
</div>


<p>It is raining softly. The night has come.
The policeman takes the lead and turns
to the left, ceasing his talk of the time
when, as a kitchen-boy in the invading
army, he saw his Major installed in the
sanctuary of the “God of Long Life.”
The road that we follow is mysterious. By
a series of alleys, of passages, stairs, and
doorways, we come out in the court of the
temple, where buildings with clawlike copings
and hornlike peaks make a black frame
to the night sky. A smoldering fire flickers
from the dark doorway. We penetrate the
blackness of the hall.</p>

<p>The cave is filled with incense, glowing
with red light. One cannot see the ceiling.
A wooden grille separates the idol from his
clients, and from the table of offerings,
where garlands of fruit and bowls of food
are deposited. The bearded face of a
giant image can be vaguely distinguished.
The priests are dining, seated about a round
table. Against the wall is a drum as enormous
as a tun, and a great gong in the form
of the ace of spades. Two red tapers, like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
square columns, lose themselves in the smoke
and the night, where vague pennants float.</p>

<p>Onward!</p>

<p>The narrow tangle of streets, where we
are involved in the midst of a shadowy
crowd, is lit only by the deep open booths
which border it. These are the work-rooms
of carpenters, engravers; the shops
of tailors, shoemakers, and venders of fur.
From innumerable kitchens, behind the
display of bowls of noodles and soup, the
sound of frying escapes. In a dark recess
some woman attends a crying child.
Among stacked-up coffins is the gleam of
a pipe. A lamp, a sidewise flicker, shows
strange medleys. At the street corners,
at the bends of heavy little stone bridges,
in niches behind iron bars, dwarfish idols
can be seen between two red candles.
After a long progress under the rain, in
the darkness and filth, we find ourselves
suddenly in a yellow blind alley which a
big lantern lights with a brutal flare. Color
of blood, color of pestilence, the high walls
of the dungeon where we are have been
daubed with an ocher so red that it seems
of itself to irradiate light. The door at
our left is simply a round hole.</p>

<p>We reach a court. Here is another
temple. It is a shadowy hall from which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
exudes an odor of earth. It is enriched
with idols, which, disposed in two rows
around three sides of the place, brandish
swords, lutes, roses, and branches of coral.
They tell us that these are the years of
human life. While I try to find the twenty-seventh,
I am left behind; and, before leaving,
the fancy takes me to look into a niche
that I find on the further side of the door.
A brown demon with four pairs of arms,
his face convulsed by rage, is hidden there
like an assassin.</p>

<p>Forward! The roads become more and
more miserable. We go past high palisades
of bamboo; and at last, emerging from
the southern gate, we turn toward the east.
The road follows the base of a high crenellated
wall. On the other hand sink the
deep trenches of a dried river-bed. Below
we see sampans lit by cooking fires. A
shadowy people swarm there like the spirits
of the Inferno.</p>

<p>And undoubtedly this lamentable river-bank
marks the end planned for our exploration,
because we retrace our steps.
City of Lanterns, we gaze again upon the
chaos of thy ten thousand faces!</p>

<p>Seeking an explanation, a reason why
this town where we loitered is so distinct
in our memories, we are struck at once<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
with this fact: there are no horses in the
streets. The city is entirely of human
beings. It seems an article of faith with the
Chinese not to employ an animal or a
machine for work by which a man may live.
This explains the narrowness of the streets,
the stairs, the curved bridges, the houses
without fences, the sinuous windings of
the alleys and passages. The city forms a
coherent whole, an industrious honeycomb
communicating in all its parts, perforated
like an ant-hill. When the night comes,
every one barricades himself. During the
day there are no doors, that is to say no
doors that close. The door here has no
official function. It is simply an opening.
Not a wall but can by some fissure give
passage to an agile and slender person.
The large streets necessary to general traffic,
and to an ordered mechanical life, would
be of no use here. Here merely collective
alleys and passages are provided.</p>

<p>An opium den, a market of prostitutes,
these last fill the framework of my memory.
The smoking den is a vast nave, empty all
the height of two stories which superimpose
their balconies inside. The building is
full of blue smoke, one breathes an odor
of burning chestnuts. It is a heavy perfume,
powerful, stagnant, strong as the beat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
of a gong. Sepulchral smoke, it establishes
between our air and dreams a middle
atmosphere which the seeker of these mysteries
inhales. One sees across the haze
the fire of little opium lamps like the souls
of the smokers. Later they will arrive
in greater numbers. Now it is too early.</p>

<p>On narrow benches, their heads helmed
with flowers and pearls, clothed in wide
blouses of silk and full embroidered trousers,
motionless, with their hands on their knees,
the prostitutes wait in the street like beasts
at a fair, in the pell-mell and the dust of
passers-by. Beside their mothers and
dressed like them, also motionless, little
girls are seated on the same bench. Behind,
a flare of petrol lights the opening
to the stairway.</p>

<p>I go. And I carry the memory of a life
congested, naïve, restless; of a city at the
same time open and crowded, a single house
with a multifold family. I have seen the
city of other days, when, free of modern
influences, men swarmed in an artless
disorder; in fact it is the fascination of all
the past that I am leaving, when, issuing
out of the double gate in the hurly-burly of
wheelbarrows and litters, in the midst of
lepers and epileptics, I see the electric
lights of the Concession shine.</p>



<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" >GARDENS</h2>
</div>


<p>It is half-past three: white mourning.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>
The sky is veiled as if with white linen.
The air is moist and raw. I go into the
city. I am looking for gardens.</p>

<p>I walk in a black gravy. Along the ditch
whose crumbling border I follow, the odor
is so strong that it is like an explosive.
There is the smell of oil, garlic, filth, ashes,
opium, and offal. I walk amid a free and
easy people who are shod with thick buskins
or sandals of straw, wearing long hoods or
skullcaps of felt, their silk or linen trousers
tucked into leggings.</p>

<p>The wall winds and undulates, and its
coping, an arrangement of bricks and open-work
tiles, imitates the back and body of
a crawling dragon. A sort of head terminates
it, from which floats a cloud of
smoke. This is the place. I knock mysteriously
at a little black door which opens.
Under the overhanging roofs I cross a
succession of vestibules and narrow corridors.
I am in a strange place.</p>

<p>It is a garden of stones.... Like the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>ancient Italian and French designers, the
Chinese have understood that a garden,
from the fact of its inclosure, must be complete
in itself and harmonious in all its
parts. Only so will nature adapt herself
to our moods, and only so, by a subtle
harmony, will the master feel at home
wherever he looks. Just as a landscape
does not consist simply of its grass and the
color of its foliage, but is distinguished by
its outlines and the slope of the ground,
so the Chinese literally construct their
gardens with stones. They are sculptors
instead of painters. Because it is susceptible
of elevation and depth, of contours and
reliefs, through the variety of its planes
and surfaces, stone seems to them a more
suitable medium for creating a background
for Man than are plants, which they reduce
to their normal place of decoration and
ornament.</p>

<p>Nature herself has prepared the materials.
The hand of Time, the frost, the rain, wear
away, work at the rock; perforating it,
gashing it, probing it with a searching finger.
Faces, animals, skeletons, hands, shells,
bodies without heads, petrified wood like
a congealed mass of broken figures, mingled
with leaves and fishes; Chinese art seizes
all these strange objects, imitates them,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
and arranges them with an ingenious
industry.</p>

<p>This garden represents a mountain cleft
by a precipice, to which steep paths give
access. Its feet bathe in a little lake half
covered with green scum, where a zigzag
bridge completes the bias outline. Built
upon a foundation of pink granite piles,
the tea-house mirrors in the greenish black
waters of the basin its soaring double roofs,
which seem to lift it from the earth like
outspread wings.</p>

<p>Below, driven straight into the earth
like iron candlesticks, the stripped trees
bar the sky, their giant stature dominating
the garden. I wander among the stones
by a long labyrinth whose windings and
turnings, ascents and evasions, amplify
and complicate the scene, simulating the
mazes of a dream around the lake and the
mountain. Finally I attain the kiosk on
the summit. The garden seems to sink
below me like a valley full of temples and
pavilions, and among the trees appears the
poem of the roofs.</p>

<p>They are high and low, detached and
massed, elongated like a pediment or swelling
like a bell. They are surmounted with
ornamental friezes decorated with centipedes
and fishes. At the intersections of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
their ridges the peaks display stags, storks,
altars, vases, and wingèd pomegranates—all
symbolic. The roofs, lifted up at
the corners like arms which hold up a too
ample robe, have a creamy whiteness or
the blackness of soot yellowed and sodden.
The air is green, as when one looks through
old window-glass.</p>

<p>The other slope brings us before the great
pavilion. The descent winds slowly toward
the lake by irregular steps leading to other
surprises. Coming out of an alley, I see
pointing in disorder toward the sky five
or six horns of a roof whose building is
hidden from me. Nothing could paint
the drunken toss of these fairy prows, the
proud elegance of these flowering stalks,
holding up a lily to the envious clouds.
Bourgeoning with this flower, the strong
framework lifts itself like a branch that one
lets spring.</p>

<p>I reach the border of the pond where the
stalks of dead lotus flowers lie across the
still waters. The silence is as profound as
the depth of a winter forest. This harmonious
place was built for the pleasure of
the members of a Syndicate of Commerce
in beans and rice, who doubtless come here
in the spring nights to drink tea and watch
the shore glimmer under the moon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span></p>

<p>The other garden is more singular.</p>

<p>It was almost night when, penetrating
into its square enclosure, I saw it filled to
its walls with a vast landscape. Picture
a mass of rocks, a chaos, a confusion of
overthrown blocks, heaped up together
as if by the force of the sea; a vision of
madness, a country as ghastly as a brain
with its convolutions bared. The Chinese
flay their landscapes. Inexplicable as nature,
this little corner seems also as vast
and as complex. Among these rocks rises
a dark and twisted pine-tree. The warped
trunk, the color of its bristling tufts, the
violent dislocation of its limbs, the disproportion
of this single tree with the artificial
country which it dominates,—like
a dragon issuing from the earth in smoke,
combating the wind and the storms,—make
this place unreal, render it grotesque
and fantastic. Here and there funereal
foliage, yews and arbor-vitæ, in their vigorous
blackness, intensify this cataclysm.
In my amazement I ponder this melancholy
document. And in the middle of the
enclosure one great rock stands in the dusk
of twilight like a monster,—a theme of
reverie and enigma.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" >THE FEAST OF THE DEAD IN THE<br>
SEVENTH MONTH</h2>
</div>


<p>Ingots of paper are the money of the
dead. From thin cards are cut the
figures of persons, houses, and animals.
The dead man must be followed by these
fragile imitations, these patterns of living
things; and, if burned, they will accompany
him where he goes. The flute guides such
souls, the beat of a gong assembles them like
bees. In the shadowy darkness, the brilliance
of a flame soothes and satisfies them.</p>

<p>Along the bank of the river the prepared
barges wait for the night to come. Scarlet
tinsel is fastened to the end of a pole; and,
whether the river at this turning seems to
derive the color of its waters from a leaden
sky, or whether it moves its swarming life
mysteriously under accumulated clouds,—still
the torches flare at the prow, the
festoons of lanterns toss from the mast,
brightening the gloom with a vivid note,—as
a candle held in the hand in a spacious
room lightens the solemn emptiness of the
night. Meanwhile the signal is given, the
flutes shrill out, the gong sounds, firecrackers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
explode, the three boatmen lean to the long
scull. The barge starts and tacks, leaving
in the wide sweep of its rudder a trail of
fire. Some one is strewing little lamps.
Uncertain glimmers on the vast flow of the
opaque waters, these flicker a moment and
perish. An arm seizes the tinsel streamer,
the ball of fire which sinks and flares in
the smoke, and touches them to the tomb
of the waters; the illusory brightness of the
light, like the gleaming of fish, fascinates
the cold drowned. Other illuminated
barges go and come. Far off are heard
detonations, and on the war-ships two
bugles, answering one another, sound together
the extinguishing of the fires.</p>

<p>The loitering stranger who, from the
shore, contemplates the vast night open
before him like a chart, will hear the return
of the religious barge. The torches are
extinguished, the shrill hautboy has died
away, but, over a precipitate beating of
drumsticks, dominated by a continual rolling
of drums, the funereal gong continues
its tumult and its dance. Who is it that
beats? The sound rises and falls, ends,
recommences, and presently swells to a
clamor as if impatient hands beat on the
metal hung between two worlds. Then
solemnly, beneath the measured strokes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
the gong returns a deep reverberation.
The boat approaches. It passes the river-bank
and the fleet of moored craft; and
now, in the heavy darkness of the opium
barges, it is at my feet. I can see nothing;
but the funeral orchestra, which had died
away for a long interval, now, after the
fashion of dogs that howl, explodes again
in the darkness.</p>

<p>This is the feast of the seventh month
when the earth enters into its repose.
Along the road the rickshaw-runners have
stuck in the earth between their feet sticks
of incense and little red candle-ends. I
must return. Tomorrow I shall come to sit
in the same place. It is all over; and still,
like the sightless dead sunk beneath an
infinity of waves, I hear the tone of the
sepulchral sistrum, the clamor of iron
drums beaten with terrible blows in the
close darkness.</p>



<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" >THOUGHTS ON THE SEA</h2>
</div>


<p>The boat makes her way between the
islands; the sea is so calm that it
scarcely seems to exist. Eleven o’clock in
the morning, and it is hard to tell whether
or not it is raining.</p>

<p>The thoughts of the voyager turn to the
past year. He sees again his trip across
the ocean in the stormy night; the ports,
the stations, the arrival on Shrove Sunday,
the trip to the house when, with a cold
eye, he scanned the sordid festivities of the
crowd through the mud-spattered windows
of his carriage. His thoughts show him
again his parents, his friends, old scenes,—and
then the new departure. Unhappy
retrospect! As if it were possible for anyone
to retrieve his past.</p>

<p>It is this that makes the return sadder
than the departure. The voyager re-enters
his home as a guest. He is a stranger to
all, and all is strange to him. (Servant,
hang up the traveling cloak and do not
carry it away! Soon it will be necessary to
depart once more.) Seated at the family
table he is a suspected guest, ill at ease.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
No, parents, it is never the same! This is
a passer-by whom you have received, his
ears filled with the fracas of trains and the
clamor of the sea, like a man who imagines
that he still feels beneath his feet the profound
movement that lures him away.
He is not the same man whom you conducted
to the fateful wharf. The separation
has taken place and he has entered upon
the exile that follows it!</p>



<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" >CITIES</h2>
</div>


<p>As there are books on beehives, on
colonies of birds’ nests, or on the constitution
of coral islands, why should we
not study thus the cities of humanity?</p>

<p>Paris, the capital of the Kingdom, uniform
and concentric in its development,
expands, as it grows, into a larger likeness
of the island to which it was once confined.
London is a juxtaposition of stores, warehouses,
and factories. New York is a
railway terminal, built of houses between
tracks. It is a pier for landing, a great
jetty flanked by wharves and warehouses.
Like the tongue, which receives and divides
its food, like the uvula at the back of the
throat placed between two channels, New
York, between her two rivers, the North
and the East, has set her docks and her
storehouses on one side, Long Island;
on the other, by Jersey City and the dozen
railway lines which range their depots
on the embankment of the Hudson, she
receives and sends out the merchandise
of all the Western continent. The active
part of the city, composed entirely of
banks, exchanges, and offices, is on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
tip of this tongue, which—not to push this
figure too far—moves incessantly from one
end to the other.</p>

<p>Boston is composed of two parts: the
new city, pedantic and miserly, like a man
who, displaying his riches and his virtue,
yet guards them for himself,—where the
streets, open on all sides to avenues, seem
to become more silent and longer in the cold,
and to listen with more spite to the step
of the passer-by who follows them, grinding
his teeth in the blast; and the hill where the
old city, like a snail-shell, contains all the
windings of traffic, debauchery, and
hypocrisy.</p>

<p>The streets of Chinese cities are made
for a people accustomed to walking in single
file; each individual takes his place in an
interminable, endless line. Between the
houses resembling boxes with one side
knocked out, where the inhabitants sleep
pell-mell among the merchandise, these
narrow fissures are insinuated.</p>

<p>Are there not special points for study?
The geometry of streets, the measurement
of turnings, the calculus of crowded thoroughfares,
the disposition of avenues? Is
not all movement parallel to these, and
all rest or pleasure perpendicular?</p>

<p>A book indeed!</p>



<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" >THE THEATER</h2>
</div>


<p>The palace of the Corporation of Canton
has a niche for its golden god,—an
inner hall where great seats, placed solemnly
about the center, indicate rather
than invite repose. And, as European clubs
would place a library, they have established
a theater, with parade and pomp, on the
far side of the court which is in front of the
whole building. It is a terrace of stone
deep in between two buildings. Consisting
only of a difference in level, the stage
between the wings and the crowd is simply
a wide, flat space above their heads. A
square canopy like that of a dais shades
and consecrates it. Another portico in
the foreground, framing it in four pillars
of granite, confers on it solemnity and
distance. Here comedy develops, legends
are told, the vision of the things which are
to be reveals itself in rolling thunder.</p>

<p>The curtain, comparable to that veil
which divides us from the world of dreams,
does not exist here. But as if each soul,
in discarding its disguises, were held in an
impenetrable tissue, whose colors and elusive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
brightness are like the livery of night;
each actor in his silken draperies shows
nothing of himself but the movement when
he stirs. Beneath the plumage of his part
the golden headdress, the face hidden under
rouge and mask, he is no more than a
gesture and a voice. The emperor mourns
over his lost kingdom, the unjustly accused
princess flees from monsters and savages,
armies defile, combats take place, a gesture
effaces years and distances, debates proceed
before the elders, the gods descend, the
genie arises from the jar. But never does
any one of the persons engaged in the
execution of a chant or of a complicated
dance deviate from the rhythm and the
harmonies which time the measure and rule
the evolutions, any more than he would
throw off his clothes.</p>

<p>The orchestra at the back,—which
throughout the piece continues its evocatory
tumult, as if, like swarms of bees that reassemble
at the beating of a caldron, the
scenic phantoms would dissipate if there
were silence,—has less a musical rôle than
the service of sustaining the whole, playing
(if we may call this prompting music) and
answering for a chorus of the populace.
It is the music which accelerates or moderates
the movement, which heightens with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
an accent more acute the discourse of the
actor, or which, surging up behind him,
brings to his ears clamor and rumor. There
are guitars, bits of wood that are beaten
like tympans, that are clashed like castanets;
a sort of monochord violin which, like a
fountain in a solitary court, by the thread
of its plaintive melody, carries the development
of the elegy; and finally, in the heroic
movements, the trumpet. It is a sort of
bugle of brass, of which the sound, charged
with harmonies, has an incredible brilliance
and a terrible stridence. It is like the
braying of an ass, like a shout in the desert,
a flourish to the sun, the clamor volleyed
from the diaphragm of an elephant. But
the gongs and cymbals hold the principal
place. Their discordant racket excites and
stimulates the emotions, deafening thought,
which in a sort of dream sees only the spectacle
before it. Meanwhile at one side of
the scene, hung in a cage of woven rushes,
are two birds like turtledoves. These it
seems are <em>pelitze</em> brought from Tientsin.
Competing innocently with the uproar in
which they bathe, they jet a song of celestial
sweetness.</p>

<p>The hall under the second portico, and
the entire court, is stuffed as full as a pie
with living heads. Among them emerge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
the pillars, and two lions of sandstone with
froglike jaws whose heads are bonneted
with children. It is a pavement of skulls
and round yellow faces, so closely packed
that the limbs and bodies cannot be seen.
Pressed together, the hearts of the crowd
beat one against the other. It oscillates
with but one movement. Sometimes,
stretching a row of arms, it surges against
the stone wall of the stage; sometimes,
withdrawing, is hidden by the sides. In
the upper galleries, the wealthy and the
mandarins smoke their pipes and drink tea
in cups with brass saucers, surveying like
gods both spectacle and spectators. As
the actors themselves are hidden in their
robes, so, as it enters each bosom, does the
drama stir under the living stuff of the
crowd.</p>



<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" >TOMBS AND RUMORS</h2>
</div>


<p>We climb and then descend; we pass
by the great banyan which, like
Atlas, settling himself powerfully on his
contorted haunches, seems awaiting with
knee and shoulder the burden of the sky.
At his feet there is a little edifice where are
burned all papers marked with black characters,
as if a sacrifice of writing was offered
to the god of the tree.</p>

<p>We turn and turn again, and by a sinuous
road we enter into a country of tombs.
Not, indeed, that they were not everywhere,
because our steps since our departure
have been accompanied by them. The
evening star, like a saint praying in solitude,
sees the sun disappear beneath her
under the deep and diaphanous waters.
The funereal region that we scan in the
pallid light of a dreary, waning day, is
covered with a rude and yellow growth like
the pelt of a tiger. From the base to the
ridge are hillocks between which our road
winds; and, on the opposite side of the valley,
as far as the eye can reach, are mountains<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
burrowed like a rabbit-warren with
tombs.</p>

<p>In China death holds as great a place as
life. As soon as they have gone the dead
become more important and more to be
suspected, enduring as morose and malevolent
powers whom it is well to conciliate.
The bonds between the living and the dead
are broken with difficulty. The rites continue
and are perpetuated. The living
must go frequently to the family tomb.
They burn incense, fire off crackers, and
offer rice and pork. In the shape of a scrap
of paper they leave a visiting-card held in
place with a pebble. The dead in their
thick coffins rest a long time inside the
house. Then they are carried out of doors
and piled up in low sheds, until the
geomancer has found the proper site and
location. Then the final resting-place is
determined on with great particularity, for
fear that the dissatisfied spirits should
wander elsewhere. They cut the tombs
in the sides of mountains, in the solid and
primordial earth; and, while the living,
in unhappy multitudes, are crowded in
valley-bottoms, in low and malarial plains,
the dead open their dwellings to sun and
space in high and airy places.</p>

<p>The form of an Omega is chosen, placed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
flat against the hill-slope; and the semi-circle
of stone, completed by the brace,
surrounds the dead person, who makes a
mount in the center like a sleeper under
his coverings. It is thus that the earth,
opening her arms, makes him her own
and consecrates him to herself. In front
is placed the tablet inscribed with the
titles and names; because the Chinese
believe that certain portions of the soul,
that stop to read the name, linger above
the tomb. This tablet forms the reredos
of a stone altar on which are deposited the
symmetrically arranged offerings. In front
of this the tomb, by the formal arrangement
of its terraces and balustrades, welcomes
and receives the living family who go there
on solemn days to honor the remains of the
deceased ancestor. Primordial and testamentary
hieroglyph! Facing it, the hemi-cycle
reverberates the invocation. All earth
which is above the level of mud is occupied
by these vast low tombs, like the openings
of pits crammed full. There are little ones,
simple ones and elaborate, some new and
others which seem as old as the rocks where
they lean. The most important are high
on the mountain, as if in the folds of its
neck. A thousand men together could kneel
in this tomb.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span></p>

<p>I myself live in this country of sepulchers,
and by a different road I regain my house
on the summit of the hill.</p>

<p>The town is below on the other side of
the wide yellow river Min, which precipitates
its deep and violent waters between
the arches of the Bridge of Ten Thousand
Ages. During the day one can see, like
the copings of the tombs, the rampart of
jagged mountains that enclose the city.
The flying pigeons and the tower in the
middle of a pagoda make one feel the immensity
of this distance. And I can see
the two-horned roofs, two wooded hills
rising between the houses, and on the river
a confusion of wooden rafts and junks whose
poops are painted with pictures. But now
it is too dark. Scarcely a fire pricks the
dusk and the mist beneath me, and by a
road I know, slipping into the funereal
darkness of the pines, I gain my habitual
post, this great triple tomb blackened with
moss and age, oxidized like armor, which
thrusts its frowning parapet obliquely into
space.</p>

<p>I come here to listen.</p>

<p>Chinese cities have neither factories nor
vehicles. The only noise that can be heard,
when evening comes and the fracas of trade
ceases, is the human voice. I come to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
listen for that; for, when one loses interest
in the sense of the words that are offered
him, he can still lend them a more subtle
ear. Nearly a million inhabitants live here.
I listen to the speech of this multitude far
under a lake of air. It is a clamor at once
torrential and crackling, shot through with
sudden abrupt rips like the tearing of
paper. I am sure one can distinguish now
and then a note and its modulations, as
one does a chord on a drum, by putting his
fingers on the right places. Has the city
a different murmur at different times in
the day? I propose to test it. At this
moment it is evening. They are volubly
publishing the day’s news. Each one
believes that he alone is speaking. He
recounts quarrels, meals, household
happenings, family affairs, his work, his
commerce, his politics. But his words do
not perish. They carry—part of the innumerable
additions to the collective voice.
Shorn of their meaning they continue
only as the unintelligible elements of the
sound which carries them; utterance, intonation,
accent. As there is a mingling
of sounds, is there a blending of the sense?
And what is the grammar of this general
discourse? Guest of the dead, I listen long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
to the murmur, the noise that the living
make afar!</p>

<p>Now it is time to return. The pines,
between whose high shafts I pursue my
road, deepen the shadows of night. It
is the hour when one commences to see
the fire-flies, hearth fires of the grass. As
in the depth of meditation an intuition
passes, so quickly that the spirit can
perceive merely a glimmer, a sudden indication;
so this impalpable crumb of
fire burns, and in the same moment is
extinguished.</p>



<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" >THE ENTRANCE TO THE EARTH</h2>
</div>


<p>Rather than assail the escarpments
of the mountain with the iron point
of my stick I should prefer to see, from this
low, flat plain across which I wander, the
mountains seated around me like a hundred
ancient men in the glory of the afternoon.
The sun of Pentecost illumines the earth,
swept and garnished and impressive as a
church. The air is so cool and so clear
that it seems as if I walked naked. All is
peace. One hears on all sides, like the cry
of a flute, the notes of chain-pumps in unison,
drawing water from the fields (three
by three, the men and women beat upon
the triple wheel, their arms hooked to the
beam, their laughing faces covered with
sweat), and a friendly territory opens before
the steps of the walker.</p>

<p>I measure with my eyes the circuit I must
follow. I know how, from the top of the
mountain, the plain with its fields will
resemble an old stained-glass window with
irregular panes set in a network of lead.
By straight footpaths of the earth that
frames the rice-fields, I finally begin on the
paved way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span></p>

<p>It crosses the rice-fields, the orange groves,
the villages,—guarded at one outlet by
their great banyan (the Father to whom all
the children of the country are brought
for adoption) and at the other, not far from
the wells of water and pits of manure, by
the fane of the local gods who, both armed
from head to foot with bow at belly, painted
on the gate, roll their tri-colored eyes
toward each other. And, as I advance
turning my head from right to left, I taste
slowly the changes of the hours, because,
as a perpetual wayfarer, a wise judge of
the length of shadows, nothing of the
august ceremony of the day escapes me.
Drunk with beholding, I understand it all.
This bridge still to cross in the peace of
the lunch hour, these hills to climb and to
descend, this valley to traverse; and already
I see, between three pines, the steep rock
where I must take up my post to assist at
the crowning ceremony of that which was
a day.</p>

<p>It is the moment of solemn reception when
the sun crosses the threshold of the earth.
Fifteen hours ago it passed the line of the
illimitable sea; and, like an eagle resting
motionless on its wings to examine the
country from afar, it has gained the highest
part of the sky. Now it declines its course<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
and the earth opens to receive it. The gorge
to which the sun sets its mouth disappears
under the level rays as if it were devoured
by fire. The mountain where a conflagration
has flared up like a crater, sends toward
the sky an enormous column of smoke.
And below, touched by an oblique ray,
the line of a torrent flashes. Behind spreads
out the earth of all the earth, Asia with
Europe; like the central height of an altar,
an immense plain; and then, far beyond
that, like a man flat on his face on the water,
France; and, in the thickest of France,
joyous and fertile Champagne. Only the
top of the golden targe can be seen now,
and at the moment it disappears the evening
star sends across the sky a dark and
vertical ray. It is the time when the sea
which follows it, lifting itself from its bed
with a profound cry, hurls its shoulder
against the earth.</p>

<p>Now I must go. So high that I must lift
my chin to see it, the summit of Kuchang,
detached by a cloud, is hung like an island
in the exquisite spaces; and, thinking of
nothing else, I walk as though my head
were detached from my body,—like a man
whom the acidity of too strong a perfume
has satiated.</p>



<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" >THE RELIGION OF LETTERS</h2>
</div>


<p>Let others discover in the range of
Chinese characters either the head of
a sheep, the arms and legs of a man, or the
sun setting behind a tree. For my part I
seek a more difficult clue.</p>

<p>All writing commences with a symbol
or line which, considered as a whole, is a
pure characterization of the individual.
Either the line is horizontal, like all things
which, in simply conforming to the laws
of their being, find sufficient reason for
existence; or it is vertical, like the tree and
the man, indicating acts and laying down
affirmations; or, if oblique, it marks movement
and the senses.</p>

<p>The Roman letter has had the vertical
line for its principle; the Chinese character
seems to have the horizontal as its essential
trait. The letter with an imperious downstroke
affirms that a thing is so; the character
is the very thing that it signifies.</p>

<p>One symbol or another is equally a sign.
Let us take figures for example. They
are all equally abstract images, but the
letter is essentially analytic. Each word<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
is an enunciation of successive affirmations
that the eye and the voice spell out. Unit
is added to unit on the same line, and the
Protean syllable changes and is modified
in a continual variation. But the Chinese
sign develops the figure, and, applying it
to a series of beings, it differentiates their
characters indefinitely. A word exists by
a succession of letters, a character by the
relation of its strokes. May we not imagine
that in these the horizontal line indicates,
for example, the species; the vertical,
the individual; the oblique, diverse of
movement, that group of traits and energies
which gives meaning to the whole; the
period, distinct on the white page, signifying
something that can only be implied? One
can therefore see in the Chinese character
a completely developed being, a written
person, having, like a person who lives,
his nature and his moods, his own acts and
his inner individuality, his structure and
physiognomy.</p>

<p>This explains the piety with which the
Chinese regard writing. They burn with
respect the humblest paper marked with a
vestige of this mystery. The sign is a
being; and, from the fact that it is common
to all, it becomes sacred. With them the
representation of ideas is almost an idol.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
Such is the foundation of that scriptural
religion which is peculiar to China. Yesterday
I visited a Confucian temple.</p>

<p>It was in a solitary quarter where everything
spoke of desertion and decay. In
the silence and burning heat of the sun at
three o’clock, we followed the sinuous street.
Our entrance is not to be by the great door
where the proud rot in their enclosure,
where that high column marked with an
official inscription in two languages guards
the worn sill. A woman, short and round-backed
as a pig, opens a side passage for
us; and, with echoing footfalls, we penetrate
into the deserted court.</p>

<p>By the proportions of the court and of
the peristyles which frame it; by the
spacious intercolumniations and the horizontal
lines of the façade; by the repetition
of the two enormous roofs, which lift their
massive black curves with a single sweep;
by the symmetrical disposition of the two
little pavilions which are before it and which
lighten the severity of the whole with the
agreeable grotesques of their octagonal
roofs; the building (to apply the essential
laws of architecture) is given a learned
aspect, a classic beauty in short, due to an
exquisite observation of rule.</p>

<p>The temple is composed of two parts.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
I suppose that the passages with their rows
of tablets on the walls, each one preceded
by a long, narrow altar of stone, offer to a
hasty worship the primary series of precepts.
Lifting our feet to avoid the sill which it is
forbidden to tread upon, we penetrate into
the shade of the sanctuary.</p>

<p>The vast high hall has the air of holding
an occult presence. It is utterly empty.
Here silence sits veiled in obscurity. Here
are no ornaments, no statues. On each
side of the hall we distinguish, between their
curtains, great inscriptions; and, before
them, altars; but in the middle of the temple,
behind five monumental pieces of stone,
three vases and two candlesticks; under an
edifice of gold, a baldachin or a tabernacle
which frames it on all sides; four characters
are inscribed upon a vertical column.</p>

<p>Here writing possesses this mystery:
it speaks. No moment marks its duration,
no position. It is the commencement of
an ageless sign. No mouth offers it. It
exists; and the worshiper, face to face
with it, ponders the written name. Solemnly
enunciated in the gloom of the
shadowy gold of the baldachin, the sign,
between the two columns which are covered
with the mystic windings of the dragon,
symbolizes its own silence. The immense<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
red hall seems to be the very color of obscurity,
the pillars are hidden under a scarlet
lacquer. Alone in the middle of the temple,
before the sacred word, two columns of
white granite seem its witness; the very
soul, religious and abstract, of the place.</p>



<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" >THE BANYAN</h2>
</div>


<p>The banyan toils.</p>

<p>This giant does not, like his brother
in India, endeavor to seize upon the earth
again with his hands; but, raising himself
with one turn of the shoulder, he lifts his
roots to heaven like accumulated chains.
Hardly has the trunk lifted itself several
feet above the soil than it stretches its
limbs laboriously, each like an arm which
tugs away at a bundle of cords it has
grasped. With a slow lengthening out,
the hauling monster strains himself and
labors in all the attitudes of effort so hard
that the rude bark splits and the muscles
stand out from the skin. There is the
straight thrust, the flexing and the support,
the twist of loin and shoulder, the slackening
of haunches, the play of fulcrum and
jack, the straightening up or reaching down
of arms which seem to put the body out
of joint. It is a knot of pythons, it is a
hydra stubbornly tearing itself away from
the tenacious earth. You might say that
the banyan lifts a burden from the depths
and upholds it with its straining limbs.</p>

<p>Honored by the humble settlement, at the
gate of the village he is a patriarch clothed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
in shadowy foliage. At his feet is installed a
furnace for offerings; and, in his very heart,
under the spreading of his branches, is an
altar with a stone doll. Witness of all that
passes, possessor of the earth encompassed
by multitudinous roots, here the ancient
lives; and, whether alone with the children
or at the hour when all the village reassembles
under the twisted projections of
his boughs (as the rosy rays of the moon,
passing across the openings of his canopy,
illumine the cabal with an outline of gold),
the colossal tree, wherever his shadow
turns, perseveres in imperceptible effort,
adding the passing moment to his accumulated
centuries.</p>

<p>Somewhere in mythology are honored
the heroes who have distributed water to
a country, and, striking a great rock, have
delivered the obstructed mouth of a fountain.
I see standing in the banyan a
Hercules of the vegetable world, a monument
of majestic labor. Would it not seem
to be by his labors (this monster in chains,
who vanquishes the avaricious resistance
of the earth) that the springs gush forth
and overflow, that grass grows afar off,
and water is held at its level in the
rice-fields.</p>

<p>He toils.</p>



<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" >TOWARD THE MOUNTAIN</h2>
</div>


<p>Coming out barefoot on the verandah,
I look toward the left. On the brow
of the mountain, among the torn clouds,
a touch of phosphorus indicates the dawn.
A movement of lamps in the house, a
breakfast while still sleepy and benumbed;
and then, with packages stowed away, we
start. By the rugged coast we drop down
to the neighboring city.</p>

<p>It is the vague hour when cities awaken.
Already the open-air cooks blow fires under
their stoves. Already in the depths of
certain booths a vacillating light illumines
nude bodies. In spite of spiked boards
that have been placed flat against openings
or hung over cornices,—huddled in corners
in every free space, men stretch and sleep.
Half awake, one scratches his side and stares
at us out of the corner of his eyes with an
air of delicious comfort. Another sleeps so
heavily that you would think he was stuck
to the stones. An old man, who has the
appearance of being clothed in the scum
that forms on stagnant waters, combs his
mangy skull with his two hands. And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
finally, I must not forget that beggar with
the head of a cannibal—his wildly disheveled
hair bristling like a black bush—who, with
one gaunt knee extended, lies flat under the
first rays of morning.</p>

<p>Nothing could be stranger than a town
at the hour when it sleeps. These streets
seem like avenues in a necropolis. These
houses exude sleep. And all of them,
because of their closed doors, seem to me
solemn and monumental. Every one, in
the sleep wherein he is buried, suffers that
singular change which comes over the faces
of the dead. Like a little child with unfocused
eyes, who frets and kneads the
breast of his nurse with a feeble hand, the
man who sleeps, with a great sigh, presses
his face to the deep earth. Everything is
silent because it is the hour when the earth
gives to drink, and no one of her children
turns in vain to her liberal breast. The
poor and the rich, the young and the old,
the just and the unjust, the judge with the
prisoner, and man like the animals, all of
them drink together like foster-brothers!
All is mystery because this is the hour when
Man communicates with his mother. The
sleeper sleeps and cannot be awakened.
He holds the breast and will not let it go.
This draught still flows for him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span></p>

<p>The street exudes odors of filth and hair.</p>

<p>Now the houses become fewer. We pass
groups of banyans; and, in the pond that
they shade, a great buffalo, of which we can
only see the back and the moon-curved
horns, stares at us with eyes of heavy stupor.
We pass lines of women going to the fields.
When one laughs her mirth spreads and
grows feebler on the four faces that follow,
and is effaced on the fifth. At the hour
when the first ray of the sun traverses the
virginal air, we gain the vast and empty
plain; and, leaving behind us the tortuous
road, we take our way toward the mountain
across the fields of rice, tobacco, beans,
pumpkins, cucumbers, and sugar-cane.</p>



<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" >THE GREAT SEA</h2>
</div>


<p>Climbing one day, I reach the
plateau, and, in its basin of mountains
where black islands emerge, I view afar
off the great sea. Certainly, by a perilous
path, it would be possible for me to gain
the shore; but whether I follow its outline
or whether I choose to take a boat, the surface
remains impenetrable to my gaze.
Well, then, I shall play on the flute, I shall
beat the tom-tom; and the boat-woman,
standing on one leg like a stork while with
the other knee she supports her nursing
baby as she conducts her sampan across
the flat waters, will believe that the gods
behind the drawn curtains of the clouds
are enjoying themselves in the courts of
their temple.</p>

<p>Or, unlacing my shoe, I shall throw it
across the lake. Where it falls the passer-by
will prostrate himself; and, having
picked it up with superstitious awe, he will
honor it with four sticks of incense. Or,
curving my hands about my mouth, I
shall cry out names. The words will die<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
first, then the sound; and the tone alone,
reaching the ears of some one, will make him
turn from side to side, like a man who
hears himself called in a dream and makes
an effort to break his bonds.</p>



<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" >THE TEMPLE OF CONSCIOUSNESS</h2>
</div>


<p>I have devoted more than one day simply
to the discovery of it, ensconced upon
its steep cliff of black rock, and it is not till
late afternoon that I know myself to be
upon the right path. From the giddy
height where I climb, the wide rice-fields
seem designed like a chart. The brink
along which I move is so narrow that whenever
I lift my right foot it is poised over
the yellow expanse of the sown village fields
spread out like a carpet below.</p>

<p>Silence. By an ancient staircase covered
with a hoary lichen I descend in the pungent
shade of the bay-trees, and, as the
footpath at this turning is suddenly barred
by a wall, I arrive at a closed door. I
listen. No word, no voice, no drum! In
vain I shake the wooden handle of the door,
and beat upon it rudely with both hands.</p>

<p>Not even a bird cries as I scale the wall.</p>

<p>This place is inhabited after all; and
while, sitting upon the balustrade where
domestic linen is drying, I sink my teeth
and fingers into the thick rind of a haddock
stolen from the offerings, the old monk<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
inside prepares me a cup of tea. Neither
the inscription above the door nor the dilapidated
idols who are honored with a
thin spire of incense in the depths of this
humble cave seem to me to constitute the
religion of the place, any more than the acid
fruit that I munch; but here—on this low
platform, which incloses a piece of muslin,—this
circular straw mat where the <em>bhiku</em>
will come soon to squat for meditation or
sleep—is everything.</p>

<p>Let me compare this vast countryside,
which opens out before me as far as the
double wall of mountains and clouds, to a
flower of which this seat is the mystic heart.
Is it not the geometric center where the
scene, united into an harmonious whole,
virtually takes on existence and a consciousness
of itself; and where, to the studious
contemplation of the occupant, all lines
converge?</p>

<p>The sun sets. I clamber up the steps of
velvet whiteness where open pine-cones are
strewn like roses.</p>



<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" >OCTOBER</h2>
</div>


<p>In vain I see the trees still green.</p>

<p>Whether a funereal haze enshroud it,
or whether an enduring serenity of sky
efface it, the year is not one day less near
the fatal solstice. The sun does not deceive
me, nor the widespread opulence of
the country. There is a calm inexpressibly
placid, a repose from which there is no
awakening. The cricket has scarcely commenced
his cry when he stills it, for fear
of being an annoyance in the midst of
plenty, since it is only dearth that gives
him the right to speak. And it seems as
if one were cautioned only with bare feet
to penetrate into the fastnesses of these
golden fields. No! The sky behind me
does not radiate the same light over the wide
harvest; and, as the road leads me by the
stacks, whether I turn the corner of a pond
here or whether I discover a village by going
farther from the sun, I turn my face toward
that broad pale moon which I have seen all
day.</p>

<p>It was at the moment of emerging from
the dark olives, when I saw the radiant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
plain open out before me straight to the
barriers of the mountain, that an interpretation
was communicated to me. Oh last
fruits of a condemned season! In the
achievement of the day is the supreme
maturity of the irretrievable year. <em>It is
finished.</em></p>

<p>The impatient hands of winter do not
strip the earth barbarously. No winds
tear at her; no frost splinters, no waters
drown her. But more tenderly than May—or
when insatiable June clings to the
source of life, possessing the noon hour—the
sky smiles at the earth with ineffable
love. Like a heart which yields to continual
importuning, is this consent; the grain separates
from the ear, the fruit falls from the
tree, the earth little by little abandons herself
to the invincible solicitor of all. Death
loosens a hand too full. The word that she
hears now is holier than that of her wedding
day, deeper, more tender and more glorious.
<em>It is finished.</em></p>

<p>The bird sleeps, the tree falls asleep in
the shade which encompasses it, the sun at
the level of the earth covers it with a long
ray. The day is done, the year is consummated.
To the celestial interrogation is
returned this amorous response. <em>It is
finished.</em></p>



<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" >NOVEMBER</h2>
</div>


<p>The sun sets on a day of peace and labor,
yet men, women, and children, their
disheveled hair full of dust and wisps of
straw, their faces and legs stained with
earth, work on. Here they cut rice, here
they gather up the sheaves; and, as on
wall-paper the same scene is repeated indefinitely,
so on every side we see great
wooden vats with men who, face to face,
beat ears of corn against the sides; and already
the plow commences to turn the clay
again. All about is the odor of grain, the
perfume of the harvest. At the end of
the plain where the men are working is a
wide river; and there, in the middle of
the fields, an arch of triumph colored by the
setting of the crimson sun completes the
peaceable picture. A man who passes near
me holds in his hand a flame-colored chicken,
another carries at the ends of his bamboo
a big tin teapot, hanging in front of him,—and
behind him a package made of some
green relishes, a bit of meat, a bundle of
those slips of silver paper that are burned
for the dead, and a fish hung beneath by a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
straw. His blue blouse, his violet trousers,
gleam against the lacquered gold of the
stubble.</p>

<p>—Let no one mock my idle hands! The
hurricane itself, and the weight of the sea
that it hurls, cannot shake the heavy stone;
but wood will float on the water, leaves
yield to the air; I, still more trifling, fix
my feet nowhere upon the earth, and the
departing light draws me with it. By the
dark roads of the villages, among pines and
tombs, and along the far-stretched fields,
I am the setting sun. Neither the happy
plain nor the harmony of these mountains,
nor the alluring color of the verdure on the
ruddy harvest, can satisfy the eye which
demands light itself. Below in that square
moat, enclosed by the mountain with a rude
wall, the air and the water burn with a
mysterious fire. I see a gold so beautiful
that all nature seems to me a dead mass;
in comparison with that light the clarity
that she can diffuse is darkest night. Desirable
elixir, by what mystic route will I be
led to participate in thy avaricious waters?</p>

<p>This evening the sun leaves me near a
great orange tree that the family which it
nourishes have begun to strip. A ladder
is leaning against the tree. I hear speech<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
in the foliage. In the lingering neutral
light of the hour I see the golden fruit
gleam through the somber leaves. Coming
nearer I see each twig etched clearly against
the green of the evening. I regard the little
red oranges, I breathe their bitter, strong
aroma. Oh marvelous harvest, promised
to One alone! Fruit shown to that
immortal part of us which triumphs!</p>

<p>Before I reach the pines night falls and
the cold moon lights me. This seems to
me to be the difference: that the sun looks
at us, but we look at the moon. Her face
is turned away, and like a fire which lights
up the bottom of the sea she makes every
shadow become visible.... In the heart
of this ancient tomb, in the thick grass of
this ruined temple, under the form of fair
ladies or wise old men, possibly I shall
meet a company of foxes! They will offer
me verses and riddles, they will make me
drink their wine, and my way will be forgotten.
These civil hosts wish to give me
entertainment. They mount standing, one
on top of another—and then, as the spell
breaks, I find myself in the straight white
footpath that leads me toward my home.
But already in the depths of the valley I
see a human fire burning.</p>



<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak" >PAINTING</h2>
</div>


<p>Let some one fasten this piece of silk
by the four corners for me, and I shall
not put the sky upon it. The sea and its
shores, the forest and the mountains, do
not tempt my art. But from the top to
the bottom and from one side to the other,
as between new horizons, with an artless
hand I shall paint the Earth. The limits
of communities, the divisions of fields,
will be exactly outlined,—those that are
already plowed, those where the battalions
of sheaves still stand. I shall not fail to
count each tree. The smallest house will
be represented with an ingenuous industry.
Looking closely, you may distinguish the
people; he who crosses an arched bridge
of stone, parasol in hand; he who washes
buckets at a pond; the litter traveling on
the shoulders of two porters, and the patient
laborer who plows a new furrow the
length of the old. A long road bordered
with a double row of skiffs crosses the picture
from one corner to the other, and in
one of the circular moats can be seen, in
a scrap of azure for water, three quarters of
a slightly yellow moon.</p>



<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak" >THE SOLITARY</h2>
</div>


<p>Have I ever lived elsewhere than in
this circular gorge hollowed in the
heart of the rock? Doubtless at three
o’clock a raven will not fail to bring me the
bread I need, unless the perpetual sound
of the falling water can keep me fat! A
hundred feet above me, as if it gushed with
violence out of the radiant heaven itself,
between the bamboos that obstruct it,
leaping the sudden verge, the torrent is
engulfed and plunges in a vertical column,
partly dark and partly luminous,—striking
the floor of the cavern with re-echoing
thunders.</p>

<p>No human eye could discover where I
am. In shadows that only the noonday
dissipates, the strand of this little lake,
shaking with the unceasing plunge of the
cascade, is my habitation. Above, where
an inexhaustible torrent falls from the gorge,
only this handful of sparkling milk-white
water reaches me directly from the generous
sky. The stream escapes by this turning;
and sometimes, mingled with the cries of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
the birds in the forest and with this soft
gushing near me, I hear the voluble noise
of falling waters behind me descending
toward the earth.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" >DECEMBER</h2>
</div>


<p>Sweeping the country and the leafy
valley, thy hand, reaching these purple
and tan-colored lands that thine eyes discover
below thee, is arrested by them on
this rich brocade. All is quiet and muffled;
no green shocks, nothing new and young
jars on the composure of the scene, on the
harmony of these full and hollow tones. A
somber cloud occupies the whole sky,
heaping with fog the cleft of the mountain.
One might say that it was dovetailed into
the horizon. With thy hand, December,
caress these large adornments, tufts of
black pine like brooches against the hyacinth
of the plain; verify with thy fingers
these details sunk in the enmeshing fog of
this winter day: a row of trees, a village.
Truly the hour is arrested. Like an empty
theater, abandoned to melancholy, the
sealed-up countryside seems to listen for a
voice so shrill that I cannot hear it.</p>

<p>These afternoons in December are sweet.
Nothing speaks as yet of the tormenting
future, and the past is not yet so dead that
it has no survivals. Of all the grass and of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
such a great harvest nothing remains but
strewn straw and dry brush. Cold water
softens the ploughed earth. All is finished.
This is the pause, the suspension, between
one year and the next. Thought, delivered
from her labor, gives herself up to recollection
with a sweet taciturnity, and, meditating
on new enterprises, like the earth
she tastes her sabbath.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" >TEMPEST</h2>
</div>


<p>In the morning, leaving a shore the color
of roses and of honey, our ship entered
upon the high sea through streamers of
low and sluggish fog. When, having wakened
from this somber dream, I seek the
sun, I see that it is setting behind us; but
before us, bounding the black, dead spaces
of the sea, one long mountain, like an embankment
of snow, bars the north from one
end of the sky to the other. This Alp lacks
nothing, neither coldness nor rigidity.
Alone in the midst of the solitude, like a
combatant who advances in an enormous
arena, our ship moves toward the white
obstacle which rises cleaving the melancholy
waters; and all at once a cloud hides the
sky from us like the hood of a wagon drawn
over it. In the cleft of daylight that it
leaves on the horizon behind us, I look
for the reappearance of the sun. The
islands shine like a lighted lamp, and three
junks stand out on the crest of the sea.</p>

<p>We are rushing now across a stretch of
water that is roughened by the clouds.
The surface heaves; and, as the motion of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
the abyss affects our deck, the prow lifts
and plunges, solemnly as if saluting, or like
a cock who measures his adversary. It is
night. From the north blows a harsh
wind full of horror. On one side a ruddy
moon, moving among disordered clouds,
strikes through them with a lens-shaped
edge; on the other the beacon-lamp of
rippled red glass is hoisted to our foresail.
Now all is calm again. The sheaf of water
gushing always evenly before us, and shot
with a mysterious fire, streams away from
our prow like a body made of tears.</p>



<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" >THE PIG</h2>
</div>


<p>I shall paint here the pig’s portrait.
He is a solid beast, made all in one piece,
without joints and without a neck; and he
sinks in front like a sack, jolting along on
four squat hams. He is a trumpet on the
march, ever seeking; and to every odor that
he scents he applies his pump-like body.
He sucks it in. When he has found the
necessary hole, he wallows enormously.
This is not the wriggling of a duck who
enters the water. It is not the sociable happiness
of the dog. It is a deep, solitary,
conscientious, integral enjoyment. He
sniffs, he sips, he tastes, and you cannot
say whether he eats or drinks. Perfectly
round, with a little quiver, he advances
and buries himself in the unctuous center
of the fresh filth. He grunts, he sports in
the recesses of his tripery. He winks an
eye. Consummate amateur, although his
ever-active smelling apparatus lets nothing
escape, his tastes do not run to the transient
perfumes of flowers or of frivolous fruits.
In everything he searches for nourishment.
He loves it rich and strong and ripe, and his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
instinct attaches him to these two fundamental
things, earth and ordure.</p>

<p>Glutton, wanton, though I present you
with this model, admit this—that something
is lacking to your satisfaction. The
body is not sufficient to itself; but the doctrine
that you teach us is not in vain.
“Do not apply the eye alone to truth, but
all that is thyself, without reserve.” Happiness
is our duty and our inheritance, a
certain perfect possession is intended.</p>

<p>But like the sow which furnished the
oracles to Æneas, the meeting with one
always seems to me an augury, a social
symbol. Her flank is more vague than
hills seen through the rain, and when she
litters, giving drink to a battalion of young
boars who march between her legs, she
seems to me the very image of those mountains
which suckle the clusters of villages
attached to their torrents, no less massive
and no less misshapen.</p>

<p>I must not omit to say that the blood of
the pig serves to fix gold.</p>



<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" >THE SOURCE</h2>
</div>


<p>Let other rivers carry toward the sea
oak branches and the red infusion of
rusty earth, roses and the bark of sycamores,
strewn straw or slabs of ice; let the Seine
in the damp mornings of December, when
half-past eight sounds from the steeples of
the city, unmoor under the rigid derricks
barges of manure and lighters full of casks;
let the River Haha, at the smoking crest
of its rapids, erect all at once, like the rude
semblance of a pike, the trunk of a hundred-foot
pine tree; and let the Equatorial rivers
carry in their turbid flow a confused world
of trees and plants; yet, flat on my face,
held fast against the current, the width of
this one river is not equal to my arms, nor
its depth sufficient to engulf me.</p>

<p>The promises of the Occident are not
lies! Learn this: this gold does not vainly
appeal to our blindness, it is not devoid
of delights. I have found that it is insufficient
to see, inexpedient to remain
standing; upon analysis my enjoyment is
in that of which I can take possession; for,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
descending the steep bank with the feet of
astonishment, I have discovered the source.
The riches of the West are not forbidden
me. Over the curve of the earth, straight
toward me, they are rolling.</p>

<p>Not the silk molded by a hand or a bare
foot, not the deep wool of the carpet used
for the consecration of a king, can be compared
to the resistance of this liquid depth
where my own weight supports me.
Neither the name of milk nor the color
of the rose can be compared to this marvel
whose descent I receive upon me. Truly
I drink, truly I am plunged in wine! Let
the ports open to receive the cargoes of
wood and grain that come to them from
the high countries; let the fishers tend their
lines to catch wreckage and fish; let the
searchers for gold filter the water and sift
the sand; the river does not carry less riches
to me. Do not say that I see, because the
eye does not suffice for this, which demands
a more subtle sense. To enjoy is to understand,
and to understand is to evaluate.</p>

<p>At the hour when the holy light evokes
to complete response the shadow that she
dissipates, the surface of these waters
opens a flowerless garden to my motionless
navigation. Between these deep violet ripples
the water is painted like the reflection<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
of tapers, like amber, like palest green,
like the color of gold. But silence! What
I have discovered is mine, and now, as the
water darkens, I will possess the night alone
with all its visible and invisible stars.</p>



<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" >DOORS</h2>
</div>


<p>Every solid door opens upon less than
is shut out by its particular panels.
Many, through progress in the occult,
have gained Yamen, the solitary state, and
the court which a great silence fills; but
if any one, after attaining this degree, at
the moment when his hand is poised for a
blow on the drum offered to visitors, hears
the sound of his name penetrating the
distance like a muffled cry (because the
spouse or the sons of the dead are shouting
loudly into his left ear), and if he vanquishes
his fatal languor long enough to draw away
one or two steps from the doors just barely
opening to his desire,—his soul will regain
its body. But no melody of a name
can rescue those who have taken the irretrievable
step over the secret sill. Without
doubt I am in such a realm, on the shallow
stones of this somber pond which surrounds
me; as, standing within its ornate frame,
I taste forgetfulness and the secret of this
taciturn garden.</p>

<p>An ancient memory has not more windings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
or more secret passages than the road
which has led me here, through a succession
of courts, grottoes, and open corridors.
The art of this restricted place is to hide
its limits from me by bewildering me.
Its undulant walls, which mount and descend,
divide it into separate sections; and,
while the tops of trees and the roofs of
houses, showing through, seem to invite the
guest to search out their secrets; these
barriers, multiplying surprises and deceits
in his path, lead him further away. Except
for a wise dwarf with a skull like the belly
of a gourd, or a pair of young storks surmounting
its ornamental apex, the chalice
of the roof shadows a hall not so deserted
but that a half-consumed stick of incense
still smokes there, and a forgotten flower
fades. The princess and her old counselor
have only just arisen from yonder seat
and the greenish air is still full of the rustle
of illustrious silk.</p>

<p>Fabulous indeed is my habitation! I
see, in these walls where the pierced copings
seem to melt away, banks of clouds; and
these fantastic windows are as masses of
leaves confusedly seen through the rifts.
The wind, leaving on each side curving
streamers, gashes irregular breaches in the
fog. Let me not gather the flower of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
afternoon from any other garden than this,
which I enter by a door in the outline of
a vase, of a leaf, of a dragon’s smoking jaws,
of the setting sun when its disk reaches
the sea-line, or of the rising moon!</p>



<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" >THE RIVER</h2>
</div>


<p>From the vast and yellow river my eyes
return to our leadsman crouching
at the side of the boat. Turning the line
in his fist with a regular motion, he sends the
lead in full flight across the muddy waters.</p>

<p>As the elements of a parallelogram unite,
so water expresses the power of a country
reduced to geometrical lines. Each drop
is a fugitive calculation, a visible measurement
always crossing the circumferential
slope; and, having found the lowest point
of a given area, it joins a current which
flows with more impetus toward the deeper
center of a still larger circle. This stream
is immense in its force and extent. It is
the outlet of a world. It is slow-moving
Asia pouring forth. Powerful as the sea,
this river has a destination and a source.
The current is without branches or tributaries.
We shall have mounted all these
days in vain! We shall never reach the
fork! Always before us, cleaving the
countryside with irresistible power and
volume, the river evenly divides the horizon
of the West.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span></p>

<p>All water seems attractive to us, but
certainly, more than the blue and virgin
sea, this appeals to that in us which is
between the flesh and the soul,—our
human current charged with virtue and
with spirit, the deep and burning blood.
Here is one of the great laboring veins of
the world, one of the arteries for the distribution
of life. Beneath me I feel moving
the protoplasm which strives and destroys,
which fills and fashions us. And, while
we remount this enormous river which melts
about us into the gray sky and swallows
up our route, it is the entire earth which we
receive, the Earth of the earth: Asia,
mother of all men, central, solid, primordial.
Oh abundant bosom! Surely I see it, and
it is vainly that the grass everywhere disguises
it; I have penetrated this mystery.
As water with a purple stain might attest
some undeniable wound, so the earth has
impregnated this river with her substance.
It is solely of gold.</p>

<p>The sky is lowering. The clouds move
slowly toward the north. To right and left
I see a somber Mesopotamia. Here are
neither villages nor cultivation; only here
and there, between the stripped trees,
four or five primitive huts, some fishing-tackle
on the bank, and a ruined boat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
which moves—a miserable vessel hoisting
a rag for sail! Extermination has passed
over this country, and the river which carries
opulent life and nourishment waters
a region no less deserted than where the
first waters issued from Paradise, when
Man, hollowing the horn of an ox, delivered
the first rude, harsh cry in the echoless
wastes.</p>



<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" >THE RAIN</h2>
</div>


<p>By the two windows before me, the two
at my left, and the two at my right,
I see and hear the rain falling in torrents
on every side. I think it is a quarter of an
hour past noon. Luminous water is all
about me. I dip my pen in the ink; and,
rejoicing like an insect in the center of a
bubble in the security of my watery imprisonment,
I write this poem.</p>

<p>It is not a drizzle that falls; it is not a
languishing and doubtful rain. The rain
grips the earth and beats upon it in serried
sullenness, with a heavy, powerful assault.
How cool it is, oh frogs, to forget the pond
in the thickness of the damp grass! No
need to fear that the rain is ceasing. It is
copious, it is satisfying. He is thirsty
indeed, my brothers, for whom this marvelous
beaker does not suffice. The earth
has disappeared, the house bathes, the submerged
trees stream; the very river, which
terminates my horizon like the sea, seems
drowned. Time has no duration, and,
straining my ears not only for the unlocking
of each new hour, I meditate the psalm<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
of the rain, so endless and so neutral in
tone. But toward the end of the day the
rain ceases, and, while the accumulated
clouds prepare for a heavier assault,—as
if Iris from the summit of the sky were
about to flash straight into the heart of
the conflict,—a black spider sways head
downward and hung by his rear in the
middle of this window which I have opened
on the leafage and the walnut-stained
North. It is no longer clear. I must
strike a light. Meanwhile I shall make to
tempests a libation of this drop of ink.</p>



<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak" >NIGHT ON THE VERANDAH</h2>
</div>


<p>Certain redskins believe that the
souls of still-born children live in the
shells of winkles. I am listening tonight
to the uninterrupted chorus of tree-frogs,
like childish elocution, like a plaintive
recitation of little girls, like an ebullition
of vowels.</p>

<p>I have long studied the ways of the stars.
Some move singly, others mount in squadrons.
I have recognized the “Doors” and
the “Three Ways.” As the clearest space
gains the zenith, Jupiter with pure greenish
brilliance moves forth like a golden calf.
The position of the stars is not left to chance.
The interplay of their distances gives me
the proportions of the void. Their swing
participates in our equilibrium, vital rather
than mechanical. I feel their oscillations
beneath my feet.</p>

<p>Arriving at the last of these ten windows,
the mystic secret consists in surprising at
the opposite window, across the shadowy,
uninhabited room, another fragment of the
heavenly chart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span></p>

<p>No intrusion will derange your dreams,
and no celestial glances into your chamber
will disquiet your repose, if before going to
bed you are careful to arrange this great
mirror before the night. Since the earth
presents such a wide sea to the stars, it
must also render itself liable to their influence
and spread its deep ocean beneath
them like a photographic developing bath.</p>

<p>The night is so calm that it seems to me
embalmed.</p>



<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" >THE SPLENDOR OF THE MOON</h2>
</div>


<p>By this key which rids me of the world,
opening to my blindness a muffled
door; by this irresistible drifting away,
by the mysterious sweetness which animates
me and the deep response of my own
heart to a soft explosion of mysterious
sounds, I realize that I am asleep, and I
awaken.</p>

<p>I had left my four windows open to the
dark and somber night; and now, going out
on the verandah, I see all the depth of
space filled with thy light, oh sun of dreams!
Far from disturbing sleep, this fire rising
from the midst of darkness creates it, overpowering
my senses more profoundly. But
not in vain, like a priest awakened for his
midnight mass, have I come from my bed
to survey this mysterious mirror. The
light of the sun is a force of life and of
creation, and our vision partakes of its
energy; but the splendor of the moon is
like thought meditating upon itself. I
contemplate her alone, lost to sound and
heat; and all creation paints itself black
beneath her brilliant expanse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span></p>

<p>What solemn orgies! Long before the
morning, I contemplate the image of the
world. And already yonder great tree has
flowered. Straight and alone, like an immense
white lilac; bride of the night, it
trembles all dripping with light. Oh star
of after-midnight! Not the pole-star at
the dizzy zenith, nor the red fire of the Bull,
nor that planet which is revealed by a
moving leaf, clear topaz in the heart of
yonder dark tree,—none of these do I
choose as queen, but high above them that
farthest star lost in infinite light, that my
eye acclaims in accord with my heart, and
recognizes only to see it disappear.</p>



<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" >DREAMS</h2>
</div>


<p>At night, on your way to listen to music,
take care to have a lantern for your
return! Shod in white, be careful not to
lose sight of either of your shoes; for fear
that, having once confided the sole of your
foot to an invisible path through the fog,
an unknown road does not lead you hopelessly
astray and the dawn find you entangled
in the top of a flagstaff or clinging
to the corner of a temple wall as a bat
does upon the head of a chimera.</p>

<p>Seeing this stretch of white wall lit by
the intense fire of the moon, the priest did
not hesitate, by means of his rudder, to
drive his little boat against it; and in the
morning a bare, bright sea betrayed nowhere
any trace of his oar.</p>

<p>The fisher, having digested this long day
of silence and melancholy—the sky, the
fields, three trees, and the water—has not
prolonged expectation so vainly that nothing
is taken by his bait. To his very marrow
he feels (with the clutch of his fish-hook)
the swift tension of his rigid line, which,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
cutting the glassy surface, draws him toward
black depths. A leaf, twirling over, does
not ripple the transparence of the pool.</p>

<p>Who knows where you would not be
liable some day to discover the mark of
your hand and the seal of your thumb,
if each night before sleeping you would
take care to smear your fingers with a thick
black ink?</p>

<p>Moored to the outer opening of my chimney,
a canoe, hanging almost vertical, awaits
me. Having finished my work, I am invited
to take tea in one of those islands
which cross the sky in the direction East
Southwest.</p>

<p>With its clustered buildings and the warm
tones of its marble walls, the locality resembles
a city in Africa or in Italy. The
system of drainage is perfect, and on the
terrace where we are seated one enjoys
pure air and a most extended view. Unfinished
buildings, ruined wharves, the
foundations of crumbling bridges, surround
this cyclad on all sides.</p>

<p>Since the jetty of yellow mud where we
live has been embraced by this pearly expanse,—from
an inundation whose progress
I survey each evening from the ramparts,—all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
illusion and enchantment mount up
to me. It is in vain that the barges come
unceasingly from the other side of the
lagoon, carrying us earth to strengthen our
crumbling embankments. What faith I
had in these green fields, road-divided, to
which the farmer would not hesitate to
confide his seeds and his labor! And then
one day, on ascending the wall, I saw them
replaced by these waters the color of the
dawn. Only a village emerges here and
there, a tree drowned to the branches;
and, at this place where a yellow gang was
digging, I see boats as close together as
eyelashes. But also I read menaces in this
too-beautiful evening! No stronger than
an ancient precept against voluptuousness
is this ruined wall, where the miserable
soldiers who guard the gates announce
the night by blasts from trumpets four
feet long. It cannot defend our black factories
and warehouses, filled with hides
and tallow, against the night and against
the irresistible spread of these rose-colored
and azure waters; for an oncoming wave
will sweep me from my feet and carry me
away, lifting me up beneath the arms.</p>

<p>And again I see myself at the highest
fork of an old tree in the wind, a child balanced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
among the apples. From there,
like a god on his pinnacle, spectator of the
theater of the world, I study with deep
consideration the relief and conformation
of the earth, its disposition of slopes and
planes. With the piercing eye of a crow
I peer up and down the country spread out
under my perch. I follow this road which,
appearing twice on the brow of little hills,
finally loses itself in the forest. I miss
nothing: the direction of smoke, the qualities
of shadow and of light, the progress of the
farmwork, a wagon which lurches along the
road, the shots of the hunters. No need
of a paper wherein I could only read the
past! I have only to climb to this branch,
and, across the wall, all the present is before
me. The moon rises. I turn my face
toward her, bathed with light in this house
of fruits. I remain motionless, and from
time to time an apple from the tree falls
like a ripe and heavy thought.</p>



<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak" >HEAT</h2>
</div>


<p>Today is more arduous than the Inferno.
Out of doors is an overpowering
sun. A blinding splendor devours all
the shade, a splendor so steady that it
seems solid. I see in everything around
me less of immobility than of stupor, an
arrested effort. For the earth in these
four moons has completed her production.
It is time that her spouse kill her, and,
unveiling the fire with which he burns,
condemn her with an inexorable kiss.</p>

<p>As for me, what shall I say? Ah, if
this flaming heat is frightful to my frailty,
if my eye turns away, if my body sweats,
if I sink on my knees, I will blame this
inert flesh; but the virile spirit will soar
free in an heroic transport! I feel it, my
soul hesitates, but nothing less than the
supreme can satisfy this exquisite and
terrible jealousy. Let others hide under
the earth, obstructing with care the least
fissure in their buildings; but a sublime
heart, pressed against the sharpness of love,
will embrace fire and torture. Sun, redouble<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
thy flames! It is not enough to
burn,—consume! My sorrow would be
not to suffer enough. May nothing impure
escape from the furnace, no blindness
from the torture of the light!</p>



<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" >THE VISION OF A CITY</h2>
</div>


<p>At the hour when, urged by an exalted
foreboding, such a man as I, wifeless
and childless, reaches the level of the setting
sun; as he attains the mountain’s
crest high above the earth and its people,
he sees the mysterious representation of a
splendid city hanging enormous in the
sky. It is a city of temples.</p>

<p>In modern cities we see the streets and
the different quarters crowd and center
about various markets and exchanges,
schools and municipal buildings, whose high
pinnacles and distributed masses stand
out above the uniform roofs; but here the
poised image of an eternal city, built by the
evening in the form of a triple mountain,
discloses not a single earthly detail, and
shows nothing in the infinite ramification
of its construction and the type of its architecture
which is not appropriate to the
sublime service it renders, although accomplished
without preparation or practise.</p>

<p>And as the citizen of a kingdom, whose
road leads to the capital, seeks to understand
the plan of the immense place; so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
the contemplative, gazing at Jerusalem,
fearing to enter it with soiled sandals,
studies the interpretation of its laws, and
the conditions of a sojourn there. Not a
nave, not a single plan of cupola or portico,
but responds to the observances of a cult;
not a movement or a detail of stairs and
terraces is disregarded in the development
of ceremony. The moats of towers, the
superimposition of walls, the basilicas, circuses,
and reservoirs,—and even the tree-tops
in the square gardens,—are molded
of the same snow; and the violet tinge of
their shadows is perhaps only such a color
of mourning as irreparable distance adds.</p>

<p>Thus one evening a solitary city appeared
for an instant before me.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" >DESCENDING THE RIVER</h2>
</div>


<p>Well, let these men continue to sleep!</p>

<p>May the boat not yet arrive at its
port! Thus shall my misery be made to
hear my last word, or I at least have
said it.</p>

<p>Emerging from a night’s sleep, I am
awakened in flames.</p>

<p>So much beauty compels my laughter.
What splendor, what brilliance! What a
wealth of inextinguishable color! It is
Aurora. Oh God, how much refreshment
this blue has for me! How tender the green
is, how cool; and, looking toward the furthest
heaven, what peace to see it still so
dark that the stars twinkle there!</p>

<p>But how well you know, my friend,
where to turn and what awaits you, if,
on lifting your eyes, you need not blush
to behold this heavenly brightness! Oh
may it indeed be this color which I am
given to contemplate! Not red, and not
the color of the sun, it is the fusing of blood
in gold. It is life consummated in victory.
It is the perpetual renewal of youth in
eternity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span></p>

<p>The thought that this is only the day
arising does not diminish my exaltation in
the least; but the thing that embarrasses
me like a lover, that makes me tremble
through my whole body, is the intention
hidden in such glory. It is my admission
to it, it is my progress toward meeting with
this joy.</p>

<p>Drink, oh my heart, of these inexhaustible
delights!</p>

<p>What do you fear? Do you not see how
the current, accelerating the movement of
our boat, leads us on? Why doubt that we
shall arrive, and that endless day will respond
to the brightness of such a promise?
I foresee that the sun will rise, and that I
must prepare to sustain its power. Oh
light, drown all transitory things in the
depth of thy abyss!</p>

<p>Let noon come, and it will be vouch-safed
me to meditate, Summer, upon thy
reign, and to include the whole day in
my perfected joy, as I sit amid the peace
of all the earth in the harvest solitudes.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" >THE BELL</h2>
</div>


<p>While the air is rejoicing in perfect
stillness, at the hour when the
sun is consummating the mystery of noon,
then the great bell, with its sonorous and
concave expanse swung to the point of
melody by the blows of its cedarn hammer,
rings with the rolling earth; and soon its
sound, receding and advancing, has crossed
mountain and plain until a wall which one
can see on the far horizon, with a series of
Cyclopean doors piercing it at symmetrical
intervals, hems in the volume of its resounding
thunder and forms the frontier of its
clamor. In one corner of this enclosure a
city is built. The rest of the place is
occupied by fields, woods, and tombs;
and here and there, under the shadow of
sycamores, the vibrations of a bronze gong
far within a pagoda deflect the echoes of
the monster as they die away.</p>

<p>I have seen, near the observatory where
Kangchi went to study the stars of old
age, the pavilion where the bell resides
under the guard of an old <em>bonze</em>, honored
by offerings and inscriptions. The outstretched<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
arms of an average man are the
measure of its width. I knock with a finger
upon its surface, which sings through a six-inch
thickness at the least shock. For a
long time I lend an ear. And I recall the
history of the molder.</p>

<p>That cord of silk or catgut should resound
under the curve of the bow, that
wood, having been instructed by the winds,
should lend itself to music,—in these
phenomena the artisan found nothing singular;
but to attack the very element, to
extort the musical scale from primitive
soil, seemed to him the means of properly
making Man resonant and awakening his
clay. So his art was the casting of bells.</p>

<p>His first bell was carried up to heaven
in a storm. The second, when they had
loaded it on a boat, fell into the deep and
muddy waters of the Kiang. The man
resolved to make a third before he died,
and this time he wished to gather into one
deep vessel the soul and the whole voice
of the nourishing and productive earth,
and pack into one thunderous vibration
the fulness of all sound. This was the plan
that he conceived, and the day that he
commenced his enterprise, a daughter was
born to him.</p>

<p>Fifteen years he labored at this work.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
But it was in vain that, having conceived
the idea of his bell, he planned with a subtle
art the dimensions, curves, and caliber;
or that, having extracted from the most
secret metals whatever listens and trembles,
he made sheets so sensitive that they would
vibrate at the mere approach of a hand;
or that, from a sonorous instrument placed
among them, he deeply studied properties
and harmonies. When a pure and faultless
bell had issued from the mold of sand,
the copper side would never respond the
expected answer to his interrogation; or,
if the double beat balanced itself in even
intervals, it was his misery never to feel
life in them,—that indefinable mellowness
and moisture which is given to words
formed in the human mouth.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the girl grew with her father’s
despair; and, when she saw that the old
man was consumed by his mania and no
longer searched for new alloys, but threw
into his crucibles blades of wheat and the
sap of aloes, and milk and the blood from
his own veins,—then a great pity was
born in the heart of the maiden, for which
women come to the bell today to venerate
her image of painted wood. Having said
her prayer to the subterranean god, she
clothed herself in wedding garments; and,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
like a dedicated victim, having fastened a
stalk of straw about her neck, she threw
herself into the molten metal. So the bell
was given a soul; and the resounding elementary
forces gained this feminine, virginal
grace, and the ineffable liquid note.</p>

<p>Then the old man, having kissed the still
warm bronze, struck it powerfully with
his mallet; and so lively was the invasion
of joy at the perfection he heard, and the
victory of its magnificence, that his heart
languished within him; and, sinking upon
his knees, he could not keep from dying.</p>

<p>Since then, and since the day when a city
was born of its widespread summons, the
metal has cracked and gives only a dying
echo of its former self. But the wise,
with a vigilant heart, still hear at the break
of day, when a faint, cold wind comes from
skies the color of apricots and of hop-flowers,
the first bell—in the celestial
spaces—and, at the somber set of sun,
the second bell—in the depths of the
immense and muddy Kiang.</p>



<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" >THE TOMB</h2>
</div>


<p>On the pediment of the funereal portal
I read an order to alight. On my right
are some broken statues in the reeds, and
an inscription on a formidable pillar of
black granite gives with wearisome detail
the laws relating to sepulchers; half obliterated
by moss a threat forbids the breaking
of vases, loud cries, or the spoiling of
ceremonial basins.</p>

<p>It is certainly later than two o’clock,
because I see that the dim, round sun is
already a third of the way down a dull and
lurid sky. I can only mount straight onward,
to survey the arrangement of the
cemetery; and, preparing my heart, I
start out on the road the funerals follow
across this home of the dead, in itself lifeless.
First come, one after another, two
square mountains of brick. Their hollow
centers open by four arches on the four
points of the compass. The first of these
halls is empty. In the second a giant
tortoise of marble, so high that I can
scarcely reach his mustached head with
my hand, supports a panegyric column.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
“This is the porch and apprenticeship of
the earth,” I thought. “Here Death halted
between the double thresholds, and here
the master of the world received supreme
homage between the four horizons and the
sky.”</p>

<p>But scarcely have I gone out by the
Northern door (it is not vainly that I leap
this rivulet!) than I see open out before me
the country of the shades.</p>

<p>Forming an avenue of alternate couples,
monstrous animals appear before me, facing
each other, successively repeated kneeling
and standing in pairs; rams, horses, unicorns,
camels, elephants; until, at the
turning where the last of the procession disappears,
these enormous and ugly shapes
loom out against the straggling grass.
Further off are ranged civil and military
mandarins. These stones are sent to ceremonial
funerals in the place of animals
and men; and, as the dead have crossed
the threshold of life, it would not be suitable
to give closer likenesses to such replicas.</p>

<p>Here, where this large cairn—hiding,
they say, the treasures and bones of a very
ancient dynasty—ceases to bar the passage,
the way turns toward the East. I
am walking now among soldiers and ministers.
Some are intact and standing, others<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
lie on their faces. One warrior without
a head still clasps the hilt of a sword in
his fist. By a triple-arched bridge the path
crosses the second canal.</p>

<p>Now, by a series of stairs where the
central hand-rail still shows the imperial
dragon, I cross the ravaged site of terraces
and courts. These are the walks of Memory,
the fugitive traces of lives which,
leaving the earth, serve only to enrich it
by decay; the steps of sacrifices, the awful
garden where what is destroyed attests
its whilom existence in the presence of what
still remains. In the center a throne supports,
a baldachin still shelters, the inscription
of a dynasty. All about, temples and
guest-houses have become a confused rubbish
among the briars.</p>

<p>And the tomb is before me.</p>

<p>Between massive projections of the square
bastions which flank it, behind the deep-cut
channel of the third stream, is a wall
which assures us that the end of our journey
must be here. A wall and nothing but a
wall, a hundred feet high and two hundred
feet wide. Eroded by the use of centuries,
the inexorable barrier presents a blind
face of masonry. A single round hole shows
in the center of the base, the mouth of an
oven or the oubliette of a dungeon. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
wall forms the front of a sort of trapezoid
formation, detached from the mountain
which overhangs it. A low molding, ending
beneath an overhanging cornice, stands
out from the wall like a console. No corpse
is so suspect as to require such a mass
being placed upon him. This is the throne
of Death itself, the regal exaltation of
sepulture.</p>

<p>A straight alley, remounting the sloping
plain, crosses a level plateau. At the end
there is only the same mountain whose
steep slope conceals in its depths the ancient
Ming.</p>

<p>And I understand that this is the
sepulcher of the Atheist. Time has scattered
the vain temples and laid the idols
in the dust, and only the arrangement of
the place remains, with the idea it expressed.
The pompous catafalques on the
threshold have not been able to retain the
dead. The cortège of his vanished glory
cannot retard him. He crosses the three
rivers, he traverses the manifold courts
filled with incense; nor is the monument that
has been prepared for him sufficient to hold
him. He cleaves his way further, and
enters into the very body and bones of
primitive earth. It is merely an animal
interment, the mixing of crude flesh with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
inert and compact clay. The king and
peasant are forever consolidated into this
death without a dream or an awakening.</p>

<p>But the shadow of evening spreads over
this cruel place. Oh ruins, the tomb has
survived you! And the brutal stolidity
of this bulk is a perfect symbol of death
itself.</p>

<p>As I return among the colossal statues
of stone, I see in the dried grass the decaying
corpse of a horse, which a dog is tearing.
The beast looks at me as he licks the blood
which trickles down his chops; then, applying
his paws again to the red carcass, he
tears off a long strip of flesh. The mangled
remains are spread about.</p>



<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" >THE MELANCHOLY WATER</h2>
</div>


<p>There is an intelligence in joy, I admit
it. There is a vision in laughter.
But that you may comprehend, my friend,
this medley of blessedness and bitterness
which the act of creation includes, now that
the melancholy season begins I shall explain
to you the sadness of water.</p>

<p>The same tear falls from the sky that
overflows from the eyelid. Do not think
to accuse the cloud of your melancholy,
nor this veil of vague showers. Shut your
eyes; listen! The rain falls.</p>

<p>Nor does the monotony of this constant
sound suffice to explain it.</p>

<p>It is a weary mourning whose cause is
within itself. It is the self-absorption of
love; it is the effort in labor. The heavens
weep over the fruitful earth. Not only
Autumn, and the future fall of fruit whose
seed she nourishes, draws these tears from
the wintry cloud. Sorrow is in the Summer;
in the flower of life is the blossoming of
death.</p>

<p>At the moment when the hour before noon
is ended, as I descend into the valley filled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
with the murmur of various fountains, I
pause enchanted by the gloom. How
abundant are these waters! And if tears,
like blood, have their perpetual source in us,
how refreshing it is, listening to this liquid
choir of voices, deep or shrill, to harmonize
from them all the shades of grief! There is
no passion but could borrow of your tears,
oh fountain! And since the brightness of
this single drop, falling from on high into
the basin upon the image of the moon,
satisfies my particular desire, not in vain
shall I have learned to love your sanctuary
through many dreamy afternoons,
oh sorrowful valley!</p>

<p>I return to the plain. On the doorsill
of his hut,—where, in the inner darkness,
gleams a candle lit for some rustic fête,-a
man sits, holding in his hand a dusty
cymbal. It rains heavily. In the midst
of this damp solitude, I hear only the cry
of a goose.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" >THE NIGHT VOYAGE</h2>
</div>


<p>I have forgotten why I undertook this
voyage, and what matter I was to negotiate,
as Confucius did when he went to
carry his doctrine to the Prince of Ou.
Seated all day in the depths of my varnished
cabin, my urgency, on these calm waters,
does not outrun the swanlike progress of
the little boat. Only occasionally in the
evening I come out to look at the aspect
of the country.</p>

<p>Our winter here has no severity. Season
dear to the philosopher, these bare trees,
this yellow grass, sufficiently attest the
passing of the time, without atrocious
cold or unnecessary violence. In this
twelfth month, cemeteries and kitchen
gardens, and a country mounded everywhere
with tombs, spread out in dull productivity.
The clumps of blue bamboo,
the somber pines above the sepulchers,
the gray-green reed-grass, arrest and satisfy
one’s gaze. The yellow flowers of the New
Year’s Candlestick and the waxen berries
of the Soot Tree give a real beauty to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
somber picture. I proceed in peace across
this temperate region.</p>

<p>Now it is night. It would be vain to
wait, stationed in the bow of this junk,
for the reflection of our wooden anchor to
trace on the beatified water the image of
that waning moon which only midnight
holds for us. All is dark; but as we move
on, propelled by the scull which steers our
prow, we need not fear mistaking our way.
These canals permit of numberless detours.
Let us pursue the voyage with tranquillity,
our eyes on yonder solitary star.</p>



<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" >THE HALT ON THE CANAL</h2>
</div>


<p>Now,—passing the place where old
men and women congregate, driven
from their far-off villages by the need of
food, and traveling on rafts made of their
house-doors, guided by the domestic duck,—encountering
waters which seem as if
they were flooded with rice, that they may
fitly enter into a region of opulence; pushing
across this large and rectilinear canal
which bounds the rude high wall enclosing
the city and its people, where the exaggerated
arch of a bridge frames with evening
the crenelated tower of a gate opening
on the dark countryside; by the wharf we
tie up our boat among square stone tombs
in the grass, the crude material of epitaphs.</p>

<p>With day our investigation begins. We
become entangled in a maze of Chinese
streets, murky and moist with domestic
odors. For a long time we follow the narrow
footpath in the turmoil of the market-place,
in the midst of a people mixed in
with their dwellings as bees are with their
wax and honey. I recall a little girl winding
a skein of green silk, a barber cleaning the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
ear of his client with a fine pincer like the
antennæ of a crawfish; a little donkey
turning a millstone near an oil warehouse,
the dark quiet of a pharmacy within whose
depths, through the gilded frame of a
moon-shaped door, two red candles flame
before the name of the apothecary. We
traverse many courts, more than a hundred
bridges.</p>

<p>Winding through narrow alleys bordered
by great sepia-colored walls, we reach the
richer quarter. If these closed doors should
open to us, they would show vestibules
flagged with stone, a reception hall with
its large bed-table, a little peach-tree flowering
in a pot, and smoky passages whose
rafters are hung with hams and bundles.
Hidden behind this wall, in a little court
we find a monster of a wisteria plant. Its
hundred creepers interlace, interweave, tie
themselves in knots, and twine into a kind
of manifold, tortuous cable, which, thrusting
out its woody, serpentine length on all
sides, spreads over the trellis, hiding its
trench in a thick sky of mauve clusters.
Let us traverse the ruins of this long suburb
where naked men are weaving silk in the
débris. We shall gain a deserted space
which occupies the south side of the enclosure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span></p>

<p>Here, they say, was formerly the imperial
residence; and in fact the triple grating
and quadruple framework of the consecutive
doors bar, with their granite outlines,
the wide flagged road on which we walk.
The enclosure contains nothing but rank
herbage; and,—at the place where the
“Four Ways” meet, which diverge toward
the four cardinal points under triumphal
arches,—with an inscription like a map
displayed to the whole Kingdom, the imperial
stele, defaced by the fissures in its
marble, slants on the decapitated tortoise
which is its base.</p>

<p>The Chinese show everywhere representations
of that inherent emptiness whose
necessity they emphasize. “Let us honor,”
says the <em>Tao teh King</em>, “Vacuity, which gives
to the wheel its utility and to the lute its
harmony!” These ruins and these fallow
tracts which are found in the same enclosure
close to the densest multitudes, these sterile
mountains shouldering the most meticulous
culture, and the wide expanse of the cemeteries,
do not impress the mind with a
false idea; for, in the density and mass of
this coherent people, administration and
justice, religion and monarchy, disclose by
contrasts no less strange the same yawning
vacancy of vain phantoms and ruins.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span></p>

<p>China is not, like Europe, elaborated
into compartments. No boundaries, no
special statutes, oppose any resistance
throughout her immense area to the spread
of her surging humanity. That is why,
powerless as is the sea to foresee its agitations,
this nation which can only be saved
from destruction by its plasticity, shows
everywhere, like Nature itself, an antique
and provisory aspect,—unstable, full of
hazards, possibilities, and deficiencies. The
present always contains the influences of
the past and the future. Man has not made
an absolute conquest of the soil, a final and
methodical arrangement. The multitude
still graze upon grass.</p>

<p>Suddenly a lugubrious cry overwhelms
us! The guardian of the enclosure, at
the foot of one of the gates designed like
an upright letter which frame the field,
sounds on the long Chinese trumpet; and
we see the horn of thin brass quiver under
the force of the sound which fills it.
Raucous and rumbling, if he declines the
trumpet toward the earth; and strident
if he lifts it; without inflection and without
cadences, the dreary blaring noise culminates
in the reverberance of a frightful
uproar,—do fa, do fa! The harsh call
of a peacock would not startle more the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
drowsiness of this abandoned garden. It
is the horn of the shepherd, and not the
bugle, which speaks and commands. This
is not the singing trumpet which leads
armies on,—it is the collective voice of
beasts; and the herd or the flocks confusedly
assemble at its sound. But we are alone;
and for nothing living does the Mongol
trumpet at this mysterious crossing of the
Ways.</p>

<p>When we return to our boat, it is almost
night. At sunset, all down the horizon
the clouds seem tinted with blue, and on
the dim earth the fields of <em>colzas</em> shine like
blows of light.</p>



<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" >THE PINE-TREE</h2>
</div>


<p>In Nature, only the tree is upright as
man is, and for a symbolic reason.</p>

<p>A man holds himself erect by preserving
his balance, and his two arms, hanging at
his sides, are no part of his unity. But,
though attached to the earth by the collective
grasp of its roots, the tree raises
itself with an effort; its multifold and divergent
parts, spreading out into a fragile and
sensitive tissue of leaves, by which it seeks
for some support in the very air and light,
constitute no mere gesture but the very
essential act and condition of its growth.</p>

<p>The family of conifers shows a special
characteristic. In them I perceive not only
a ramification of the trunk into branches,
but also their articulation on a stem that
rises straight and single,—an articulation
which gradually multiplies into threadlike
leaves. The fir-tree is typical of such a
class, with the symmetrical intersections
of its branches, whose essential plan is
simply a perpendicular crossed by a graded
series of horizontal lines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span></p>

<p>This type includes many variations in
the different regions of the world. The
most interesting is that of the pines I studied
in Japan.</p>

<p>Rather than the rigidity usual to wood,
the trunk appears to have a fleshy elasticity.
Under the tension on the strong, cylindrical
stem of compact fibers, its sheath splits
and the rough bark, divided into pentagonal
scales,—with deep cracks between
them from which resin oozes abundantly,—expands
in tough layers. And if, through
the suppleness of its jointless body, the
trunk yields to the exterior forces which
violently assail it or seductively allure it,
the tree resists by its inherent energy;
and the drama of its pathetic struggle is
written in the tormented twisting of its
boughs.</p>

<p>Thus, along the tragic old road to Tokkaido,
I have seen the pines sustain the onslaught
of the powers of the air. In vain
the wind of the ocean lays them low. Clinging
with every root to the stony soil, the
invincible trees writhe, twist upon themselves,
and,—like a man braced on all
fours, who butts with his head, kicks in
all directions, and hunches himself together,—they
seem to grapple with the antagonist,
to re-establish themselves, and to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
straighten up under the Protean assaults
of the monster who would overcome them.
All along the solemn beach I have passed
their heroic lines in review on this somber
evening, and watched all the vicissitudes of
the battle. One leans backward, and
stretches toward the sky a monstrous
panoply of halberds and shields which he
brandishes in Briarean fists; another, full
of wounds, mutilated as by blows of clubs,
and bristling on all sides with jagged
stumps, still wars and waves a few feeble
boughs; another, which seems thrown upon
its back, still battling against the dust,
maintains itself on the powerful buttress
of its gathered haunches; and finally, I
saw giants and princes who, massively
settling upon their muscular loins, by the
reiterated efforts of their Herculean arms,
continued to hold their ground on all sides
against the tumultuous enemy.</p>

<p>I have still to speak of the foliage.</p>

<p>If I compare to the pines the species of
trees that flourish in fertile earth, in rich
and mellow soil, I discover these four characteristics
in them; that the proportion of
leaf to wood is greater; that the leaf is
deciduous; that, flattened, it shows an obverse
and reverse side; and, finally, that the
foliage, growing upon the boughs, diverging<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
from a common center, is arranged
like a single bouquet.</p>

<p>The pine grows in dry and stony soil;
therefore its absorption of the elements
which nourish it is less immediate, and
necessitates on its part a stronger and
completer elaboration, a greater functional
activity,—and, if I may so put it, more personal.
As it is limited in its supply of water,
it does not expand like a chalice. This one
that I observe divides its foliage, spreads
a handful on every side. Instead of leaves
which receive the rain, these are tufts of
little tubes which reach into the surrounding
dampness and absorb it. And that is why,—independent
of the seasons, sensitive
to more continuous and subtle influences,—the
pine shows a perennial foliage.</p>

<p>Thus I explain the aerial character of
its foliage, fragmentarily suspended. As
the pine lends the irregular outline of its
boughs to the lines of the harmonious landscape,
better to enhance the charm and the
brilliancy of Nature, it also spreads everywhere
the shadow of its singular tufts;
over the power and the glory of Ocean,
blue in the sun; over the harvest fields;
and obstructing the design of the constellations
or the dawn upon the sky. It
sweeps its branches beneath azalea bushes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
flaming near the surface of lakes blue as
gentian, or above the steep embankments
of the imperial city, close to the silver,
grass-grown waters of the canals; and the
evening on which I saw Fuji like a colossus,
like a virgin throned in the clarity of the
Infinite, the dark tuft of a pine was silhouetted
against the dove-colored mountain.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" >THE ARCH OF GOLD IN THE
FOREST</h2>
</div>


<p>When I left Yeddo the great sun was
flaming in the clear sky. Toward
the end of the afternoon, arriving at the
junction of Utsonomiya, I perceive that a
shadow has darkened all the sunset. Composed
of huge, heaped-up clouds, it presents
that tumultuous and chaotic aspect that a
sky sometimes shows when, like the veiled
fire of footlights, a gleaming streak on the
horizon throws long shadows across the
dim fields, bringing out each object in clear
relief. Drowsing on the wharf just now,
and for a long time in the train moving
westward, I have been a spectator of the
decline of day and the gradual deepening
of darkness. With one glance I have caught
the whole plan of the country. In the
background, deep forests and the folds of
cumbrous mountains; in the foreground,
detached footpaths which bar the way, one
behind the other, like spaced and parallel
barriers. Where the trenches we follow
show us a cross-section of the earth, we see
first a fine mold, black as coal; then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
yellow sand; and finally clay, red with
sulphur or cinnabar. Avernus spreads out
before us! Does not this scorching sun,
this low sky, this surrounding harshness
of volcanoes and fir-trees, correspond to
that black abyss from which the visions
of dreams arise? Indeed it was with a
royal wisdom that the ancient shogun,
Ieyasu, chose this place for his disembodied
spirit to enter the kingdom of shades,
and, by dissolving in silence into their
shadows, transmute death into godhead
as a temple is created of a tomb.</p>

<p>The forest of cryptomeria is truly a
temple.</p>

<p>Often before, at this hour of somber
twilight, I had crossed the double avenue
of these giant trees,—which extends twenty
leagues to conduct from the red bridge the
annual ambassador who bears Imperial
presents to this ancestral shrine,—but this
morning, at the hour when the first rays
of the sun turned the banks of somber
verdure above me to rose color in the golden
wind which swept them, I penetrated into
the colossal nave, deliciously filled with a
resinous odor, after the cold night.</p>

<p>The cryptomeria belong to the family of
pines, and the Japanese have named it
sengui. It is a very tall tree, whose trunk,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
free of twists and knots, maintains an inviolable
rectitude. There are no branches,
but indicated here and there, as is the way
with pines, not by detail and relief but
by mass and contour, the leaves float like
tatters of black smoke about the mystic
pillar; and the forest of these tall trunks,
all of the same height, loses itself in the
tangled canopy of shadowy, inextricable
foliage. The place is simultaneously limitless
and confined, filled and empty.</p>

<p>The marvelous houses are scattered
among these trees that have been parked
for centuries.</p>

<p>I shall not describe the whole plan of
the shaded city, though it is marked on my
fan to the minutest detail. In the middle
of the dedicated forest I have followed
enormous avenues that a scarlet torii bars.
At a bronze basin, under a roof inlaid with
the moon, I have filled my mouth with
lustral waters; I have climbed the stairs;
among many pilgrims I have passed indescribable
opulence and space, the entrance
to an enclosure that is like a dream formed
of a confusion of flowers and birds; barefoot,
I have penetrated to its innermost golden
heart. I have seen the priests with haughty
faces,—with head-dresses of horsehair, and
clothed with ample trousers of green silk,—offer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
the morning sacrifice to the sound
of flute and mouth-organ. And for me the
sacred <em>kagura</em>,—his face framed in white
linen, holding the tasseled bough of the pine
devoutly between his hands,—has executed
the dance which consists of continual
advance and retreat.</p>

<p>As Chinese architecture has for its chief
element the baldachin; stories being raised
as on the poles of a pastoral tent; so, in
Japan, the roofs made of tiles, or those
made of a substance as powerful, strong,
and light as a thick felt, show but a slight
curve; they are no more, in their elegant
power, than a cover; and all this construction
evolves from the idea of a box.</p>

<p>Since the time when Jingô Tennô conquered
the isles of the rising sun with his
fleet, the Japanese have everywhere preserved
some signs of the sea: the habit
of tucking up their clothes to the waist,
these low cabins which are their homes under
an uncertain sun, the multitude of neat
little objects and their careful stowage,
the absence of furniture,—do they not all
betray the confined life of the sailor on his
precarious deck? And these wooden houses
are themselves nothing more than the
enlarged cabin of a galley, or the box of a
palanquin. The extensions, intersected by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
carpentry; the oblique shafts, of which
the figured heads jut out at four angles;
still recall the quality of being portable.
Among the columns of the temple, arches
seem the means by which it may be lifted.</p>

<p>Houses? Yes. Here the very sanctuary
is a house. They have relegated the bones,
sealed in a cylinder of bronze, to the high
mountainside; but in this room, seated
on the unalterable name, the soul of the
dead continues a spectral habitation in
obscure and secret splendor. Reversing
the procedure which employs wood and
stone and makes them of value without
adding any strange element to their own
properties, artifice has existed here only to
annihilate its material. These enclosures,
the sides of these boxes, these floors and
ceilings, are no longer made of beams and
planks but of certain opaque images conjured
forth. Color decorates and adorns
the wood, lacquer drowns it under impenetrable
waters, paint covers it with enchantments,
sculpture deeply undermines and
transfigures it. An end of timber—the
least spike appearing on the magic surface—is
covered with arabesques and interlacing
lines; but, as on screens we see trees
in flower and mountains steeped in a radiant
glow, these palaces emerge entirely golden.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
On the roofs, on the façades, which strike
the full light of day, only the ridges are
burnished with scattered brightness; but
the sides are brightened in vast surfaces
through the shadow; and inside also, the
six walls of the box are painted with the
splendors of hidden treasure, flaming brilliance
revealed by numerous mirrors.</p>

<p>Thus the magnificent shogun does not
inhabit a house of mere wood, but his
dwelling in the center of the forest is in the
light of setting suns; and ambrosial incense
abides beneath these sweeping boughs.
Through the immense spaces of this region,
deeply slumbering like a god amid its sea
of trees, an occasional dazzling cascade
plashes between the leaves, mingling with
their ceaseless whisper.</p>



<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" >THE PEDESTRIAN</h2>
</div>


<p>In June, with a gnarled stick in my hand
(like the god Bishamon), I am that
mysterious passer-by who crosses the path
of groups of simple, ruddy peasants; and,
at six in the evening, while the storm-cloud
in the sky endlessly continues its
monstrous assault on the mountain, I
am that lonely man one sees upon this
abandoned road.</p>

<p>I am going nowhere in particular. My
wanderings are without end and without
profit. The itinerary of the soldier or the
merchant, the piety of the sterile woman
who, with hopeful humility, seven times
makes a tour of the holy peak,—these have
nothing in common with my travels. The
footprint pointed in the usual direction
does not allure my own far enough to lead
me astray; and soon, urged by the intimacy
there is in treading this moss through the
heart of the woods, to pick the black leaf
of a camellia by the weeping of a secret
waterfall,—I flee suddenly, like an awkward
deer. Then, amid the silence of growing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
things, poised on one foot, I await the
echo. How fresh and comic the song of
this little bird seems to me! And how the
cry of the rooks below delights me! Each
tree has its personality, each little beast
his part, each voice its place in the symphony;
as they say music is comprehended,
so I comprehend Nature.</p>

<p>It is like a story of many details, where
only the proper names are given. As my
walk—and the day—proceeds, I advance
also in the development of a philosophy.
Already I have discovered with delight that
all things exist in a certain accord; and,
though believing this secret relationship,
by which the blackness of this pine below
espouses the clear green of these maples,
it is my purified sight only which establishes
it; so, because of this restoration of
the original design, I call my visit a
Revision. I am the Inspector of Creation,
the Verifier of all present things. The
reality of this world is the cause of my
beatitude. In ordinary hours we employ
things for their usefulness, forgetting their
purer value: that they should exist at all.
But when, after a long effort, pushing
through branches and briars, I place my
hand on the burning shoulder of this heavy
rock in the heart of a glade, the entry of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
Alexander into Jerusalem is alone comparable
to the sublimity of my achievement.</p>

<p>And I go on and on! Each one of us
contains in himself the autonomous power
of motion by which he moves toward his
food and his work. As for me, the even
motion of my legs serves to measure for
me the intensity of more subtle appeals.
The allurement of everything! I feel it in
the silence of my soul. I understand the
harmony of the world. When shall I
surprise its melody?</p>



<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" >HERE AND THERE</h2>
</div>


<p>In the street called Nihon Bashi, near the
merchants of books and lanterns, of
embroideries and bronzes, miniature gardens
are sold; and, as a studious idler amid
this fantastic display, I mentally compare
these little fragments of the world. The
artists have subtly shown themselves
masters of the exquisite laws by which the
lines of a landscape are composed, like those
of a physiognomy. Instead of drawing
nature they reproduce it, constructing their
counterfeits from the very elements of the
original, which they borrow—as a rule is
illustrated by an example. These images
are usually exact and perfect replicas. All
sorts and kinds of pines, for instance, are
offered me to choose from; and their position
in the jar, with their height as a scale,
proportionately shows the dimensions of
their original territory. Here is a rice-field
in Springtime; in the distance is a hill
fringed with trees (they are made of moss).
Here is the sea, with its archipelago and its
capes! By the artifice of two stones, one
black, one red, and rather worn and porous,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
they have represented two islands that
appear to be joined together, whose difference
in distance is shown only by their
different colors, apparently due to the light
of the setting sun. And even the many-colored
sunset is represented by this bed of
motley pebbles covered with the contents
of two carafes.</p>

<p>Now, to amplify my thought!</p>

<p>The European artist copies nature according
to the sentiment that he has for it.
The Japanese imitates it according to the
materials with which it furnishes him.
One expresses himself, the other expresses
nature. One creates, the other mimics.
One paints, the other constructs. One is a
student; the other, in a way, a master.
One reproduces in its detail the spectacle
that he surveys with a searching and subtle
gaze; the other disengages its law with a
flash of the eye, in the freedom of his fancy;
and applies it with a scriptural conciseness.</p>

<p>Here the first inspiration of the artist is
the material on which he exercises his hand.
Good-humoredly, he consults its intrinsic
properties, its tints; and, appropriating the
soul of the brute thing, he constitutes himself
its interpreter. Of all the things that
he might say, he expresses only the essential<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
and significant characteristics; and, merely
making a few shy indications here and there,
leaves to the paper the task of concealing
all those infinite complexities which are
implied freely because they are taken for
granted. It is a frolic of certitude, it is
caprice with restraint; and the underlying
idea, snared by such a method of argument,
imposes itself upon us with an insidious
conviction.</p>

<p>Now, first of all, to speak of Color!
We note that the Japanese artist has reduced
his palette to a limited number of
general and predetermined tones. He
understands that the beauty of a color
resides less in its intrinsic quality than in
its implicit accord with contrasted tones.
And because of the unmodified blending of
two values laid on in equal quantities, he
repairs the omission of the many intermediate
shades by the vivacity that he gives to
the juxtaposition of the essential notes;
calmly indicating one repetition or two.
He knows that the value of a tone results
more from its position than from its intensity;
master of keys, he transposes them as
he will. Furthermore, as color is nothing
less than the particular homage that all
visible things render to the universal light,
everything fitly takes its place within the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
frame through the power of color, in accord
with the theme that the artist has chosen.</p>

<p>But now the roving eye remains fixed;
and, instead of contemplating, it interrogates.
Color is the passion of matter; it
signalizes the participation of each object
in the common source of glory. Design
expresses the energy proper to each being;
his action, his rhythm, his postures. The
one makes manifest his relations to space,
the other fixes his movement in time. One
gives the form, the other gives the sense.
And as the Japanese, careless of relief,
paints only by contour and mass, the chief
characteristic of his design is a schematic
stroke. While the tones are in contrast,
the lines are in unity; and while the painting
is a harmony, the design is an idea;
and if the interpretation of this idea comes
in a flash of recognition, complete and instantaneous,
the design has a satisfactory
abstract significance and expresses the idea
in all its purity, just as well as might a
word made of letters. Each form, each
movement, each group furnishes its hieroglyph.</p>

<p>I understand this when I revel among
these bundles of Japanese prints. At Shidzuoka,
among the ex-votos of the temple,
I have seen many admirable examples of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
this art. A warrior leaps from the vermilion
wood like a frantic exclamation.
This prancing or kicking thing is no longer
the picture of a horse, but the symbol of
his revolt against bondage; a sort of reversed
figure 6, equipped with a mane
and tail, represents his repose in the grass.
Embraces, battles, landscapes, crowds, fitted
into a small space, resemble the designs on
seals. This man bursts into laughter; and,
falling, he no longer seems a man, but
immediately becomes his own character in
writing.</p>

<p>With horrible and careless crudity, the
French or English construct barbarous
barracks; pitiless toward the earth they
disfigure, concerned only with their expansion,
seizing upon all possible space with
their eyes, if not with their hands. They
exploit a view as they would a waterfall.
The Oriental knows enough to flee from
vast landscapes, where multifold aspects
and divergent lines do not lend themselves
to that exquisite co-ordination between the
eye and the view which alone makes a sojourn
possible for him. His home is not
open to all the winds. Choosing a retreat
in some peaceful valley, his care is to
achieve a perfect location where his view<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
composes so harmonious a landscape that
it is impossible to imagine seeing it otherwise.
His eyes furnish him with all the
elements of happiness, and he replaces
furniture with open windows. Inside, the
art of the painter, ingeniously tracing his
visions upon a fictitiously transparent window,
multiplies the imaginary openings.
In the ancient imperial palace that I visited,
its magnificent and movable treasures had
been carried away, and there remained only
the pictorial decorations arranged in a
black room,—the familiar visions of its
august inhabitant.</p>

<p>The paper dwelling is composed of successive
apartments, divided by partitions
which slide on moldings. A single theme
of decoration has been chosen for each of
the series, and it is introduced by screens
similar to the wings of a theater. I can
prolong or shorten my contemplation at
will. I am less the spectator of the painter
than his host; each subject is expressed by
a choice in harmony with the tone of the
paper, a color representing the opposite
end of the gamut. It is so at Gosho. An
indigo and cream motif suffices for the room
called “Freshness and Purity,” seeming
all filled with sky and water. But at Nijo
the imperial habitation is done in gold<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
alone. Emerging from the matting-covered
rafters, painted life-size, crowns of the pine-tree
extend their grotesque boughs along
the sunlit walls. The Prince, upon his
seat, saw only great bands of tawny fire;
and his sensation was of floating on the
evening sky with awful sunset fires beneath
him.</p>

<p>At Shidzuoka, at the time of Rinzainji,
I saw a landscape made of colored dust.
They had put it under glass, for fear that
a breath would blow it away.</p>

<p>Before the golden Buddha in the leaves,
time is measured by the burning of a little
candle; and in the depth of this ravine, by
the dripping of a triple fountain.</p>

<p>Swept away, overthrown in the chaos
and turmoil of the incomprehensible sea,
lost in the churning abyss, mortal man with
all his strength clutches at something that
may prove solid in his grasp. That is why
he accords the permanence of wood, metal,
or stone to the human figure, and makes
it the object of his devotion and his prayer.
Besides their common names, he gives proper
names to the forces of nature; and, by
means of a concrete image which symbolizes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
them like a syllable, still mysteriously conscious
in his abasement of the superior
authority of the Word, he calls upon it in
his necessities. Thus, like a child who
constructs the history of his doll from everything
around him, humanity in its memories
unites all that it discovers with all that it
dreams, and so composes the romance of
mythology.</p>

<p>Here beside me is this poor little old
woman, who makes her salutation by
striking her hands carefully together before
a colossal female statue, in whose bosom
an ancient prince, when led by a toothache
and a dream to honor the skull of an ancestor,
inserted the worn sphere after
finding it wedged by the jawbone in the
roots of a willow. At my right and at my
left, all the length of the dark cavern, the
three thousand golden Kwannon, each one
resembling the others in the embellishment
of arms that frame it, are aligned in rows of
a hundred, in ranks fifteen deep. A ray
of sunlight flickers over this barrier built
of goddesses. Seeking the reason for uniformity
in this multitude, and from what
bulb all these identical stalks have sprung,
I find that the worshiper here doubtless
wishes a wider sounding-board for his
prayers, and imagines that in multiplying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
the object of his entreaty he increases its
efficacy.</p>

<p>But not for long did the sages rest their
eyes on the eyes of these crude likenesses.
Having perceived the unity of all things,
they found the basis of their philosophy in
that fact. Though each individual were
transitory and capricious, the richness of
the common fund remained inexhaustible.
No need that Man should apply his hatchet
to the tree, or his cleaver to the rock; in
the grain of millet and the egg, alike in the
immobility and the convulsions of sun and
sea, he found the same principle of plastic
energy; and the earth sufficed for the
construction of its own idols. Further,
admitting that the whole is formed of
homogeneous parts; if, to better pursue
their analysis, the Sages turned it back
upon themselves, they discovered that the
fugitive, blameworthy, unjustifiable thing
in them was the fact of their presence in the
world,—and that the element in them
which was free of space and limitless of
duration was the very conception they had
formed of this contingent character.</p>

<p>If a diabolical fraud had not led them
astray at that point, they might have
recognized in the harmony of this principle
of independent existence (with its main<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
idea common to all and its expression so
varied) a faith similar to that in the Word,
which implies a vow—the voluntary restitution
of breath to its divine Source. For
every creature, born of the impression of
Divine Unity upon indeterminate matter,
is the very acknowledgment that he makes
to his Creator, and the expression of the
nothingness from which he has been drawn.
This is the living, breathing rhythm of the
world; where Man, dowered with consciousness
and language, has been instituted their
priest, to make dedication and offering of
them,—and, of his own nothingness united
to essential grace, to make a filial gift of
himself, through love’s most intimate choice.</p>

<p>But these blind eyes refused to recognize
unconditional being; and to him whom
they call Buddha was it given to perfect
the Pagan blasphemy. To return to this
comparison of the Word; from the moment
that they ignored the object of the discourse,
its order and sequence escaped them
entirely, and nothing remained but the
ravings of delirium. But a horror of that
which is not the Absolute is essential to
man; and to escape the frightful circle of
your vanity, Buddha, you have not hesitated
to embrace Nothingness! For instead
of explaining all things by their final end,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
he searched in himself for their intrinsic
principle; and, finding there only nothingness,
his doctrine teaches this monstrous
communion.</p>

<p>This is the method; that the Sage,—having
banished successively from his mind
the ideas of form and of space, and the very
idea of an idea,—arrives finally at Nothingness,
and so enters into Nirvana. And
people are awed by this revelation! As
for me, I find that to the idea of Nothingness
they have added that of Enjoyment. This
seems to me the last and most Satanic
mystery; the silence of a creature intrenched
in its final refusal, the incestuous
quietude of a soul seated on its integral
difference!</p>



<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" >THE SEDENTARY</h2>
</div>


<p>I live in a corner of the highest story of
a square and spacious building. I have
placed my bed in the embrasure of the
window; and when the evening, like the
bride of a god, silently mounts her couch,
I lie at full length with my face turned
toward the night. From time to time,
lifting an eyelid heavy as if in death, my
sight has swum in a rose-colored glow. But
at this hour, emerging with a long sigh from
a sleep as heavy as Adam’s, I awaken to a
vision of gold. The light tissue of the
mosquito netting waves under an ineffable
breeze. Here is light purged of heat; and
I twist slowly in the delicious coolness. If
I put out my bare arm, it seems to me
fitting to plunge it to the shoulder in the
consistency of this glory, to sink my hand
searchingly into the fountain of eternity,
as tremulous as its source. I see the magnificent
lake of light spread with an irresistible
intensity in a sky that is like a
concave and liquid basin the color of
mulberry leaves. Only the face of the sun,
and its insupportable fires, only the mortal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
thrust of its rays, can drive me from my
bed. I foresee that I shall have to pass
the day in fasting and detachment. What
water will be pure enough to quench my
thirst, to satisfy my heart? From what
manner of fruit shall I strip the skin with a
golden knife?</p>

<p>But when the sun has reached the zenith,
followed by the sea as is a shepherd, and
by the races of mankind arising in successive
multitudes,—it is noon, and everything
that occupies a dimension in space is
enveloped by the soul of a fire whiter than
lightning. The world is effaced and the
seals of the furnace broken; all things have
vanished in the heart of this new deluge.
I have closed all the windows. Prisoner
of the light, I take up the journal of my
captivity. And now, with my hand on
the paper, I write by the same impulse
that moves the silkworm, who spins its
thread of the leaf that it devours. Sometimes
I stroll through the darkened room,
through the dining-room or the parlor; or
for a moment I rest my hand on the cover
of the organ, in this bare space whose
center the work-table fills, standing intrepid
and alone. Surrounded by these white
streaks that mark the fissures in my prison,
I develop the thought of holocaust. Ah,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
if it is enviable to dissolve in a flaming
embrace, swept away upon a whirlwind
with vehement breath,—how much more
beautiful the torture of a spirit devoured
by light!</p>

<p>And, when the afternoon is filled with
this burning softness, by which the evening
is preceded, like the sentiment of paternal
love; having purified my body and
my mind, I remount to the highest room.
Seizing an inexhaustible book, I pursue
there the study of Being, the definition of
person and substance, of qualities and
possibilities.</p>

<p>Between two rows of houses, the glimpse
of a river terminates my street; the enormous
silver current smokes, and great
ships with white sails move across the
splendid gap with a smooth and superb
grace. I see before me the very River of
Life whose image I borrowed when a child,
to discourse of Morality. But today, stubborn
swimmer though I am, I no longer
cherish any hope of landing flat on my face
among the reeds in the slime of the other
bank, under the salutation of the palms,
in a silence interrupted only by the cry
of a parrot. Although the shrill cascade
invites me, drumming upon the gravel
behind the fleshy foliage of the magnolia;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
although the fabulous boughs are bending
beneath their weight of myrobalans and of
pomegranates; I will think of them no more—turning
my glance to a more angelic
science, to this mystic garden which is
offered for my enjoyment and my recreation!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" >THE EARTH VIEWED FROM THE
SEA</h2>
</div>


<p>Arriving from the horizon, our ship
is confronted by the wharf of the
Earth; and the continent, emerging, spreads
its immense architecture out before us.
In the morning distinguished by one great
star, as I mount the gangway the earth’s
blue apparition appears before my eyes. To
defend the sun against the pursuit of the
restless ocean, this continent has established
the deep-set solidity of its ramparts. Their
breaches open into a happy countryside.</p>

<p>For a long time in the full daylight we
follow the frontier of another world. Carried
along by the trade-winds, our ship
veers and rebounds upon the resilient abyss
to which it confides its whole weight. I
am caught up to the Azure, I am stuck
there like a cask. Captive of the infinite,
suspended at the intersection of sky and
water, I see below me all the somber Earth
laid out like a chart—the whole world,
humble and enormous! My separation
from it is irrevocable. All things are far
from me, and only sight connects me with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
them. It will never again be vouch-safed
me to set my foot on the solid earth, to
construct with my hands a dwelling of wood
and stone, to eat in peace food cooked at
the domestic fire. Soon we will turn our
prow toward the shoreless sea; and, under
an immense spread of sail, our advance into
the midst of eternity will be shown only
by our signal lights.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" >SALUTATION</h2>
</div>


<p>And again I am permitted to salute
this land similar to Gessen and
Canaan. Tonight, as our ship tossed in the
wheat-colored moonlight, at the entrance
to the river, what a sign the Dog-Star was
to me, low beyond the sea; the golden
watchman at the foot of a stretch of stars,
glowing splendor at the far horizon! These
flowing waters having led us into the heart
of the countryside, I disembark, and on
my road I see below me the image of the
round sun repeated in the fields, ruddy in
the green rice.</p>

<p>It is neither cold, nor too warm. All
nature has the warmth of my body. How
the feeble cry of these crickets touches me!
At this end of the season, in this testamentary
moment, the union of the sky and
the earth (less sacramental today than it
is amorous) consummates the matrimonial
solemnity.</p>

<p>O cruel destiny! Is repose always apart
from me? Is there no peace for the heart
of man? A spirit born for one only joy
can pardon no delay. Absolute possession<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
some day will not dry my tears! No joy
of mine will be sufficient to make reparation
for the bitterness of this grief.</p>

<p>And I will salute this earth; not only
with a frivolous jet of intricate phrases,
but with the sudden discovery in me of an
immense discourse circling the foot of the
mountain like that sea of wheat crossed by
a triple river. Like that plain and its roads,
I fill the space between the mountains.
With both eyes lifted toward the eternal
mountains, I salute the venerable body of
the earth. Through the air I no longer
see its mere semblance, but its very flank,
the gigantic assemblage of its limbs. O
borders of the slope all about me! It is
through you that we receive the waters of
the sky, and you are the recipients of the
Offering!</p>

<p>This damp morning, at the turn of the
road between the tomb and the tree, I saw
the somber and enormous hill barred at
the foot by the flashing line of a river,
which stood out like a stream of milk in
the light of noon.</p>

<p>Like a body sinking through water of
its own weight, during these four motionless
hours I have been advancing to the
heart of the light, feeling a divine resistance.
I am holding myself erect in perfectly white<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
air. While I cast no shadow, I am celebrating
the orgy of the maturity of day.</p>

<p>No longer, under the sudden brilliance
of a greedy sun, does the earth burst into
violent flowering. Lustral moment! A
continual breath blows to us from between
the Orient and the North. The opulent
harvest, the trees weighed down with their
burdens, stir ceaselessly under the soft
irresistible wind. The fruits of the great
earth are stirred in the purifying splendor.
The sky is no longer high above us; brought
low, it submerges and damps us. I, a new
Hylas (like one who watches fishes below
him suspended in watery spaces) see through
this milkiness, this silver wherein I am
drowned, a dazzling white bird with a pink
throat flash into sight and lose itself in a
brilliance that my eye cannot sustain.</p>

<p>The whole day does not exhaust my
salutation. At the somber hour,—when
the wedding procession, armed with flaming
torches, conducts the bridal carriage
through the forest of orange trees, with all
my being I lift applause and acclamation
toward the red Sign I see upraised above
the wild circle of flaming mountains.</p>

<p>I salute the threshold, the material evidence
of Hope, the recompense of man
uncompromised; I lift my hands toward this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
exposition of the color of life! Autumnal
triumph, the foliage above my head is
thick with little oranges! But once again
my gaze, which has been uplifted toward
Death from infancy, must return to mankind;
like the singer who, with parted lips,
waits to carry on his part—his heart lost
in the beat of the music, his eye on his score.</p>



<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" >THE HANGING HOUSE</h2>
</div>


<p>By a subterranean stairway I descend
to the hanging house. Just as the
swallow fashions her shelter with patience,
between the planks and the rafter, and the
seagull glues her nest like a pannier to the
rock; so, by a system of clamps, bolts,
and girders driven into the stone, the
wooden box that I inhabit is solidly attached
to the arch of an enormous porch hollowed
in the mountain itself. A trap-door arranged
in the floor connects me with the
world; by means of it on both these days,
letting my little basket drop at the end of a
cord, I have drawn it up filled with a little
rice, some roasted pistachio nuts, and vegetables
pickled in brine. In a corner of the
formidable masonry, like a trophy made of
Medusa’s tresses, hangs a fountain whose
inexhaustible lament is carried away in a
whirlpool. I draw up the water I need by
means of a cord knotted in open meshes,
and the smoke of my cooking mingles with
the spray of the cascade.</p>

<p>The torrent is lost among the Palms,
and I see below me the crowns of the great
trees from which they draw sacerdotal
perfumes. And, as a shattering of crystal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
is enough to disturb the night, all the keyboard
of the earth is awakened by this
neutral, hollow jingling of rain on that
deep flint.</p>

<p>I see in the monstrous niche where I am
ensconced the very tympanum of the massive
mountain, like an ear hollowed in the
temporal rock. And, collecting all my
attention, bending all my joints, I will
attempt to hear, above the murmur of
leaves and birds, those sounds which this
enormous and secret pavilion undoubtedly
gives access to: the oscillations of the universal
waters, the shifting of geological
strata, the groans of the hurtling earth under
an effort contrary to gravitation.</p>

<p>Once a year the moon rises at my left
above this escarpment, cutting the shadows
at the height of my waist on so exact a
level that, with ever so little more delicacy
and precaution, I could float a plate of
copper upon it. But I like best the last
step of the stairway, which descends into
the void. Many times I have awakened
from meditation, bathed in the dews of
the night like a rose-bush; or, in the comfortable
afternoon, I have appeared to throw
handfuls of dry letches like little red bells
to the monkeys perched below me on the
furthest branches.</p>



<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" >THE SPRING</h2>
</div>


<p>The crow, adjusting one eye on me as
the clock-maker does on his watch,
would see me, a precise, miniature person—a
cane like a dart between my fingers—advancing
by the straight footpath, moving
briskly along.</p>

<p>The country, between the mountains
that enclose it, is as flat as the bottom of
a frying-pan. To right and left the work
of harvesting goes on; they shear the earth
as if it were a sheep. I dispute the width
of the path, and my place on it, with an
uninterrupted file of workers; those who
are going to the fields, spade at belt; those
who are returning, bending like scales under
the weight of double baskets whose form
is at once round and square, joining the
symbols of the earth and the sky.</p>

<p>I walk a long time; the open air is as
close as a room, the sky is somber, and the
long columns of stagnant smoke are stationary
like the remains of some barbaric
pyre. I leave the shorn rice-fields and the
harvest-fields of slime; and, little by little,
I mount the narrowing gorge. Useless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
reeds succeed the fields of sugar-cane;
and three times, with shoes in hands, I
cross the rapid waters gathered into the
current of a river. I have undertaken to
find the source of one of these streams that
feed the river, here, where it arises in the
heart of a five-gorged valley. The ascent
becomes more difficult as the thread of the
cascade extends. I leave beneath me the
last field of potatoes, and, all at once, I
have entered into a wood like that which
on Parnassus served for the assembly of the
Muses! All about me the tea-plants lift
their distorted shoots and their dry, somber
foliage,—so high that my stretched hand
cannot reach it. Charming retreat!
Quaint and mysterious shadow, enameled
with a perpetual flowering! A delicate
perfume, which seems to survive rather
than emanate, flatters the nostril while
recreating the spirit. And in a hollow I
discover the spring! Like grain out of a
furious hopper the water from beneath the
earth bursts forth, leaping and bubbling.
Impurities are absorbed. Only that which
is pure, untainted at the source, leaps out.
Born of the roseate sky (gathered in what
profound matrix!) the virgin water, with
living force, pours from the opening like a
cry. Happy those from whom a new word<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
bursts with violence! May my mouth be
supplied forever like this spring,—which,
sustained by a perpetual, solitary renewal,
cares not that it must serve for the works
of Man,—for those lowlands where, spreading
wide and inundating the tilth, it will
nourish the vast, stagnant harvest-fields.</p>



<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" >THE TIDE AT NOON</h2>
</div>


<p>When the time comes that he can sail
no longer, the mariner makes his
home near the sea; and when it moans he
rises to watch, unable to sleep longer; like
a nurse who hears a little child complain
in the night.</p>

<p>I do likewise, and, by the living virtue
of the sea in my blood, my mind communicates
with the movement of the waters as
does a city by its secret drains.</p>

<p>While I am speaking or writing, resting
or eating, I participate in the sea, which
rises toward or recedes from me. And
often at noon, temporary citizen of this
commercial coast, I gaze on what the tide
brings us: the tribute of the ocean gathered
into this flowing channel in one wide current
of yellow water.</p>

<p>I observe the approach of all the people
of the sea, the procession of ships towed
by the tide as if on the chain of a barge,
the junks with their four bulging sails as
smooth and stiff as blades, in a puff of wind.
Those from Foutchéou carry an enormous
fagot of beams lashed to each side; then,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
among a scattering of tri-colored sampans,
come the giants of Europe, the American
sailing ships full of gasoline; all the
“camels” of Madian, all the cargoes of
Hamburg and London, all the carriers of
the Coast and the Islands.</p>

<p>The air is very clear. I enter into a light
so pure that neither my secret conscience,
it seems, nor my body, offer resistance to
it. It is deliciously cool. With closed
mouth, I breathe the sunlight, my nostrils
open to the exhilarating air. Meanwhile
noon sounds from the tower of the Customs;
the ball of the semaphore drops, all the
boats mark off the hour, cannon thunder,
the Angelus rings its part, the whistles of
the factories mingle with the long tumult
of the siren.</p>

<p>All humanity gathers together to eat; the
sampan man at the stern of his skiff, lifting
a wooden cover, surveys with a contented
eye the simmering of his stew. The wharf-hands,
tied up in thick bundles of rags, each
yoke carried over the shoulder like a pike,
surround the open-air kitchen; those who
are already served, all laughing, seated on
the edges of the wheelbarrows, with bowls
of smoking rice between their hands, test
the heat with the ends of their greedy
tongues.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span></p>

<p>The regulator of Life’s level rises; all
the sluices of the earth are filled; the rivers
suspend their course; and the sea, mingling
her salt with their sands, joins them,
to drink fully at their mouths. It is the
hour of plenitude. Now the tortuous canals
which cross the city become long serpents
of close-packed barges advancing amid
vociferations; and the irresistible waters,
in their expansion, float bridges of boats
and dead bodies from the mud, like corks.</p>



<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" >THE PERIL OF THE SEA</h2>
</div>


<p>As I cannot eat, I remount to the poop,
a piece of bread in my pocket; and,
staggering, deafened, blown about, I join
in the wild darkness and the indescribable
confusion of noise. In this void, opening
my lips, I carry a mouthful blindly to them.
Soon, leaving the binnacle, little by little
I can make out the form of the ship, and
beyond, just at the limit of the contracted
horizon, the sea in the clutches of the wind.
In that black circle, I see the pale charging
cavalry of the foam.</p>

<p>Nowhere about me is there solidity. I
stand amid chaos. I am lost in the inner
caverns of Death. My heart is grasped
by the bitterness of the last hour. This
is no menace brandished at me; it is simply
that I have intruded into the uninhabitable.
I am of no importance. I am voyaging
through an indifferent element. I am
at the mercy of the moods of the deep, of
the mind, of the powers of the abyss. In
the cataclysm that surrounds me, no compact
holds; and the handful of human
souls which this narrow vessel contains,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
may be scattered over the waters like a
basket of bran. A delicate balance sustains
me on the bosom of this abyss which
is ready to join with my own weight and
engulf me.</p>

<p>To escape this disheartening sight, I
go to my cabin and to bed. Head to the
wind, the boat lifts to the surge; and every
once in a while the enormous hull, with
its iron plate and boilers, its armament and
storerooms filled with coal and projectiles,
settles back upon the waves like a rider
who gathers himself, gripping tightly with
his knees, before a leap.</p>

<p>Then a little calm comes, and below me
I hear the screw continue its feeble and
homely sound.</p>

<p>But before the day which follows is ended,
our ship enters the lonely port enclosed like
a reservoir by a mountain range. Here is
Life again! Touched with an artless joy,
I may resume my survey of the brisk and
lively spectacle, of the spontaneous play of
common interests, of this assiduous, multifold,
intermingled activity by which all
things exist together.</p>

<p>Just as we drop anchor, the sun, through
a gap in the mountains which hide it,
shoots toward the earth four jets of fire so
intense that they seem emissions of its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
very substance. Before raising them vertically
to the illimitable sky, this king, appearing
upon the highest ridge (Eye of our
eyes, in the merciful possession of the Vision
made visible!) makes, at this supreme hour,
a majestic exposition of distance and origin.
For a welcome I have this farewell, richer
than a promise! The mountain is vestured
in rose and violet, the marriage of light and
night. I am overcome with a deep, strong
sweetness. I lift to God my gratitude still
to be alive, and my whole being expands
in the realization of my reprieve.</p>

<p>This time I shall not drink the bitter
waters!</p>



<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" >ON LIGHT</h2>
</div>


<p>I do not think—I entirely reject the
idea that colors constitute the first
element, and that the sun is only the
synthesis of their spectrum. I cannot see
that the sun may be white, and that each
color gives a share of its own virtue to it,
and that their accord determines it. There
is no color without an extrinsic support;
from which we learn that it is itself an
exterior thing, the diverse witness that
matter renders to the pure source of indivisible
splendor. Do not pretend to
separate light; since it is light which divides
darkness, producing seven notes according
to the intensity of its effort. A vase of
water or a prism, by the interposition of a
transparent and thick medium and the
refractive play of facets, allows us to watch
this in the act. The free direct ray remains
invariable, but color appears as soon as
there is a captured refraction, which matter
takes to itself as an especial attribute.
The prism, in the calculated dispersive
powers of its three angles and the concerted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
action of its dihedral triple mirror, encloses
all possible play of reflections, and restores
to the light its <em>equivalent in color</em>. I compare
light to a woven substance,—where
the rays constitute the warp, and where
the wave of color, always implying a
repercussion, is the woof. Color is nothing
more than that.</p>

<p>If I examine the rainbow or the spectrum
projected on a wall, I see a gradation in the
nature of the tints, as well as in their relative
intensity. Yellow occupies the center
of the spectrum and permeates it to each
edge, where the outer tones exclude it by
degrees of obscuration. We can understand
it to be the most immediate veil of
light, while red and blue are reciprocal
images of light metamorphized into two
equally balanced tones. Light plays the
rôle of mediator; it prepares the mixed
colors by blending them in neighboring
bands, thus provoking complementary
tones. In it and by it, extreme red combined
with green—as blue combines with
orange—disappears in the unity of white.</p>

<p>Color, then, is a particular phenomenon
of reflection, which the reflecting body,
penetrated by the light, appropriates and
restores in an altered form. This form is
the result of the ray’s complete and ruthless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
analysis and examination which will not be
denied.</p>

<p>And the intensity of tones varies, following
a gamut of which yellow is the keynote,
according to the more or less complete
response of matter to the solicitations of
the light.</p>

<p>Who would not be shocked with the
affirmation of the classic theory that the
color of an object results from its absorption
of all the colored rays except that one whose
livery it seems to wear? On the contrary,
I should think that color, which constitutes
the visible individuality of each thing, is
an original and authentic quality in it;
and that the color of the rose is no less its
property than the perfume.</p>

<p>That which we measure is not the rapidity
of light, but simply the resistance that its
surroundings oppose to it, while transforming
it.</p>

<p>And visibility itself is only one of the
properties of light; differing with different
subjects.</p>



<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" >HOURS IN THE GARDEN</h2>
</div>


<p>There are people whose eyes alone are
sensitive to light; and to them, for
the most part, the sun is but a free lantern,
by whose light every one carries on his especial
work; the writer with his pen, the
farmer with his ox. But I absorb the light
with my eyes and ears, my mouth and
nose, and all the pores of my skin. Like
a fish, I float in it and I drink it in.</p>

<p>Just as they say the fires of morning and
afternoon will ripen wine that is exposed in
bottles, as though it were still the grapes
on the vine; so the sunlight penetrates my
blood and clears my brain. Rejoice in
this tranquil and piercing hour! I am like
seaweed in the current, moored only by a
thread, its weight floating on the water,—or
like the Australian palm; a tuft with
great swaying leaves, high upon a tall
trunk,—which last, flecked with the gold
of evening, curl, wave, and uncurl with
the outspread balance of wide and supple
wings.</p>

<p>The formidable aloe sprang, undoubtedly,
from one of the dragon’s teeth that Cadmus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
sowed over the Theban field. The sun
drew this warrior from a ferocious soil.
It has a heart of sword-blades, a flowering
of glaucous thongs, belts, and straps. Sentinel
of solitude, color of the sea and the
sword, its artichoke bristles on all sides
with enormous poniards. Persistently it
upraises its harrows, rank after rank, until,
having flowered, it dies; and from its heart
springs a flower like a post, like a candelabra,
like a standard driven into the final corpse!</p>

<p>By my order they have closed the door
with bolt and bar. The porter sleeps in
his corner, his head sunk on his breast;
all the servants sleep. Only a pane of
glass separates me from the garden; and
the silence is so complete that, all the way
to the walls of the enclosure, the mice
between two floors, the lice in the breasts
of the pigeons, the bubble of a dandelion
on its fragile stem, must feel the noise in
their midst as I open the door. The
celestial spaces appear to me, with the sun
just where I had imagined it, in the afternoon
splendor. On high, a kite descends
in wide circles through the blue; from the
summit of a pine a cone falls. I am glad
to be where I am. My walks in this
enclosed place are distinguished by precaution
and a taciturn and quiet vigilance,—as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
a fisher fears to startle fish in the water
if he so much as thinks. There is no trace
here of that free and open country which
distracts the mind and leads on the body.
The trees and the flowers conspire to my
captivity; and, as in a child’s game the
player must continually go back and begin
again, so all the turns in this thick grass
lead me to that furthest corner, where the
wells are. Across the little hill, by means
of a long cord, I shake the invisible pail.
Like a ripening fruit, like a poet maturing
his thought, I rest in the immobility all
about me where life is measured only by
the circling of the sun, by the beating of
my pulse,—by the growth of my hair.
Vainly the turtle-dove makes her pure and
sad appeal, heard from afar. I will not
stir from the house today. In vain the
murmur of the great river reaches me.</p>

<p>At midnight, returning from a ball where,
during many hours, I have watched human
beings,—some in black, others in quainter
draperies,—turning in couples (each figure
expressing incomprehensible satisfaction) to
the gymnastic modulations of a piano; at
the moment when the porters who have
reached the top of the stairway lift the
curtain of my litter, I see in the light of
my lantern, under the torrential rain, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
magnolia tree adorned with great ivory
globes. Oh, fresh apparition! Oh, confirmation
of imperishable treasure in the night!</p>

<p>The theme of the earth is expressed by
the detonations of this distant drum, as
one might hear a cooper in a cavernous
cellar striking his casks with measured
blows. The magnificence of the world is
such that one anticipates at any moment
having the silence shattered by the terrific
explosion of a cry, the <em>taraba</em> of a trumpet,—the
delirious exultation, the intoxicated
elation of copper! The news goes about
that the rivers have reversed their courses;
and, charging the swollen streams, all the
battering force of the sea descends upon
the island continent, to trade there the
produce of the horizon. The work of the
fields benefits by this change; chain-pumps
function and confabulate; and, as far as
the inundated harvest-meadows, mingled
with the somber prairie, mirror the guava-colored
evening, all space is filled with an
hydraulic murmur. A ragged tuft of pine
crosses the circle of the moon. In another
place, at this most shining hour, four
lovers holding a sugar-cane, stamping on
the golden wheels of a press, make a stream
of blue and white milk flow like the water<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
of the sea through a very green field. And
suddenly, against the blue, is thrust this
young Bacchic face, inflamed with passion
and with a superhuman gaiety, the eye
sparkling and cynical, the lips twisted in
mockery and invective! But the heavy
blows of a hatchet in meat show me clearly
enough where I am; and also the arms of
this woman who, red to the elbows with
blood dark as tobacco juice, drags out
entrails from the depth of that great pearl-white
carcass. A basin of iron, that some
one turns over, flashes. In the rosy and
golden light of Autumn, the whole bank of
the canal is screened from my sight under
pulleys which draw great blocks of ice,
baskets of pigs, unwieldy bunches of
bananas, streaming clusters of oysters, like
pudding-stones,—and barrels of edible
fishes so large that they are garnished and
polished like porcelain. I have the energy
still to notice these scales, where, with one
foot placed on the platform, one fist clinging
to the chain of bronze, they overturn the
mighty heap of watermelons and pumpkins,
and bundles of sugar-cane, tied with blossoming
creepers from which spring tiny
lip-colored flowers. And suddenly, lifting
my chin, I find myself seated on a step of
the stairway, my hand in the fur of my cat.</p>



<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" >THE BRAIN</h2>
</div>


<p>The brain is an organ. The student will
acquire a solid principle if he grasps
this idea firmly: that the nervous organism
is homogeneous in its center and in its ramifications,
and that its function is simply
such as its mechanical efficiency determines.
Nothing justifies the excessive belief which
imputes to the “white” or “gray” matter
(accessory to sensory and motor activity)
the function of secreting the intelligence
and the will, as the liver does bile. A
confusion in terms seems to imply it. The
brain is an organ, like the stomach and
the heart; and, just as the digestive or
circulatory systems have their precise function,
the nervous system has its own, which
is the production of sensation and movement.</p>

<p>I use the word “production” designedly.
It would be inexact to see in the nerves
simply threads bound together, agents inert
in themselves, of a double transmission;
“afferent” (as they say) here; “efferent”
there; ready indifferently to telegraph a
noise, a shock, or an order of the inner mind.
The apparatus assures the opening of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
cerebral wave, constant as a pulse, to all the
body. Sensation is not a passive phenomenon;
it is a special state of activity. I
compare it to a vibrating cord, on which
the note is formed by the correct position
of the fingers. By sensation, I verify
facts; by movement, I control action.
But the vibration is constant.</p>

<p>And this view permits us to advance our
investigation further. All vibration implies
a source, as all circles have a center. The
source of nerve vibration resides in the
brain, which, separated from all the other
organs, fills the entire cavity of the sealed
skull.</p>

<p>The rule of analogy, at the outset, forbids
seeing in it anything but the agent of
reception, of transformation, and of digestion
(so to speak) of the initial commotion.
One can imagine that this duty has devolved
especially on the peripheric matter which
the white substratum forms, as an agency
of amplification and of composition; and
finally, that the complicated organs of the
base of the brain are so many laboratories,
setting the scene for distribution, arranging
keyboards, installing the apparatus of substitution
and of regulation.</p>

<p>We must now consider the vibration
itself. By this I mean a double movement,—one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
by which a body proceeds from a
point to return to it. Here is the element
we seek,—the symbol which constitutes
essentially all life. The vibration of our
brain is the agitation of the source of life,
the emotion of matter in contact with that
Divine Unity whose possession constitutes
our typical personality.</p>

<p>This is the umbilical cord of our dependence.
The nerves, and the contact that
they give us with the exterior world, are
but the instruments of our knowledge; and
it is in this sense alone that they are the
conditions of it. As one makes trial of a
tool, so we fashion the education of our
senses. We learn to know the world
through its contact with our intimate
identity.</p>

<p>The brain, then, is nothing but the
organ of animal intelligence, sensitive only
in the animals, intelligent in man. But,
since it is merely a particular organ, it
cannot be the support of the mind, nor of
the soul. We could not do this discourtesy
to any part of our body, which is the active
and living image of God. The human
soul is that by which the human body is
what it is,—its act, its continually operating
seed, and (as the Schools would say) its
form.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" >LEAVING THE LAND</h2>
</div>


<p>The sea has come to seek us. She pulls
at our cable, she draws the side of our
boat away from the gangway. With a
great quiver, it increases little by little the
distance that separates it from the encumbered
wharf and the port of seething life.
And we follow the heavy tranquil water in
its lazy windings. Here is one of the
mouths by which the earth disgorges,
spewing its thick muddy waters forth to
mingle with the tangled grasses of the sea.
Of the soil where we once dwelt, there
remains only its crude color, ready to
liquefy. And, right before us, a fire low
down in the limpid air indicates the horizon
and the desert.</p>

<p>While we are eating, I feel that the boat
has stopped. Through its body, and
through my own, there is freer breathing.
The pilot is disembarking. Under the
electric light on his dancing canoe, he
salutes us with a wave of the hand. They
cast off the ladder, and we depart. We depart
in the light of the moon!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span></p>

<p>And I see the curved line of the horizon
before me, like the frontier of immeasurable
slumber. All my heart despairs, with
the thick sob one utters falling asleep, as
the shore recedes behind us and fades out
of sight. Ah, Sea, it is thou! I re-enter.
There is no bosom so sweet as Eternity,
and no security comparable to uncircumscribed
Space. Our news hereafter will be
that each evening will bring us the moon,
rising on our left. I am delivered from
change and from diversity. Here there
are no vicissitudes but those of day and
night; no solicitation but the sky’s before
our eyes, and no repose but the bosom of
these great waters which reflect it.</p>

<p>Cleansing purity! Here we may be absolved
in the Absolute. What matter now
the fermentation of people, the intrigues of
marriages and wars, the operation of gold
and of economic forces, and all the confused
scheme of things below? Everything is
simplified to the immediate act, according
to the multifold passion of men and of
things. Here I possess the central rhythm
in its essence: the alternating rising and
setting of the sun, and a simple fact; the
appearance of the constellations on the
horizon at an appointed hour.</p>

<p>And all day long I study the sea as one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
studies the eyes of a woman who understands.
I follow its reflection with the
attentiveness of one who listens. In comparison
with this pure mirror, how fare the
gross intricacies of your tragedies and your
ostentations?</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" >THE LAMP AND THE BELL</h2>
</div>


<p>Of this sense of expectation through all
the universe (and of my regret still to
be alive) one is the sign and the other the
expression. One is Duration itself, and the
other—suddenly sonorous—marks a moment.
One measures silence, the other
probes obscurity. One solicits me and the
other fascinates me. Oh sentinel, oh bitter
patience,—double vigilance! While one
flames, the other apportions.</p>

<p>The night takes away our witnesses, we
no longer know where we are. Lines and
tints, our personal arrangement of the
world all around us (whose center we carry
about with us, according to the angle from
which our eye gazes at the moment), these
are no longer present to show us our position.
We are reduced to ourselves. Our
vision has no longer the visible for limit, but
the invisible for its cell. Homogeneous,
close, impassive, compact, in the bosom of
this obscurity the lamp is clear and definite.
It appears full of life, it contains its own
oil. By virtue of its flame it is able to
drink itself. It attests that of which all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
abyss is the absence. As it has taken a
sufficient supply in the evening, it will last
until rosy light is in the sky, until the
dispersing of vapors like the fumes of new
wine. It has a golden provision to last till
dawn. As for me, let me not die in the
night! Let me endure until the day!
Let me not be extinguished except in light!</p>

<p>But if the night closes our eyes, it is in
order that we may listen the more. Not
only with the ears, but with the hearing of
our soul—breathing as fishes do. Something
accumulates, in the darkness: a number that
must be sounded. I hear the
bell, like the necessity for speech, like our
inner silence summarized, like the Word
speaking in secret. During the day we
hear a whirlpool of ceaseless words weaving
through the activities of human beings.
The night extinguishes them, and only the
measuring of Time remains. (I see, I
listen). What does this clock apportion?
What is measured? What strikes? What
is Time? Here, to betray it, is the artifice
of hourglass and clepsydra; the snare of a
clock forces the hour to declare itself. I
see it; the duration of time is reported to
me; I am ruled by this march of time and of
all the hours. I have my escape, I contain
the creative pulse; outside of me the blow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
which suddenly resounds declares all the
hidden effort of my heart, the motor and
the worker in my body.</p>

<p>Just as the navigator follows the coast
of a continent, verifying all the lights one
after another; so, midway between horizons,
the astronomer standing on the
moving earth, like a mariner on his bridge,
calculates the exact hour with his eyes on
the most complete sextant of all. The
enormous scheme of things, the innumerable
universe is reduced to the establishing
of these proportions, to the elaboration of
these distances! There is no trembling
of the stars that does not influence our
emotions, no design woven by the harmony
of the planets in which we may not be involved.
There is no star revealed by the
microscope on the photographic plate to
which I may be indifferent. The hour
strikes, and by its act the immense sky
seems to lighten. Between the pendulum
buried in the heart of a sick-room and the
flaming angel which successively reaches
in the sky all the points prescribed by its
circular flight, there is an exact response.
I shall not compute another hour; I shall
not face it with less decision for all that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" >THE DELIVERANCE OF
AMATERASU</h2>
</div>


<p>No mortal man can, without incongruity,
honor the moon by a public devotion.
She is the computer and the fabricator of
our months, the spinner of a thread avariciously
measured. In the clear light of
day we rejoice to see everything in harmony,
beautiful like an ample, multicolored fabric.
But as soon as the night is come, I find
the fatal shuttle weaving again across the
web of the sky. My friend, may thine eye
alone avow it, glamoured by its evil light,—and
those five fingernails which shine
on the handle of thy lute! But the sun,
always pure and young, always the same,—intensely
radiant, intensely white,—does
it abate each day the flowering of its
glory, the generosity of its face? And
who can look at it without being forced
to laugh also? With a laugh as free, then,
as when you gather up a pretty little child,
give your heart to the good sun! Why,
in the most shallow waters, in the narrowest
puddle left at the turning of the public
road, it will find something to mirror its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
ruddy face; and shall the secret soul of
Man alone remain so sealed that it refuses
such an image, and shows in the depth of
its shadows no touch of gold?</p>

<p>Scarcely had the shabby race of sons of
the soil commenced to dabble in the mud of
the nourishing earth than, pressed by the
furious desire to eat, they forgot the splendid
sun, the eternal epiphany in which they
were permitted to live. As the engraver,
applying himself to cut his block according
to the grain of the wood, occupies himself
but little with the lamp above his head,
which lights him; just so the farmer, reducing
his whole view to that of his two
hands and the black back of his buffalo,
caring only to plow his furrows straight,
forgot the luminous heart of the universe.
Then Amaterasu was indignant in the sun.
She is the soul of the sun by which it shines,
and she is the breath in its sounding trumpet.
“When the beasts,” she said, “have
filled their bellies, they love me, they rejoice
with simplicity in my caresses; they
sleep in the warmth of my glance, lulled
by the regular beating of their blood within
their bodies, the inner rhythm of their
crimson life; but Man, brutal and impious,
is never sated with eating. All day long
the flowers adore me, and nourish their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
devout hearts in the splendor of my face.
Only Man is badly set on his stem. He
deprives me of the sacred mirror in him
that was made for my reflection. Let us
fly, then, let us hide this beauty that is not
honored!” Like a dove which slips into
a hole in a wall, she descended into a deep
cavern at the mouth of the river Yokigawa
and, with an enormous rock, hermetically
sealed the enclosure.</p>

<p>It grew dark—not the ordinary blackness
of night, but the very darkness there
was before the world was made. Crude
and atrocious blackness filled the living
earth. There was a strange vacancy in
the sky; space had lost its center, the person
of the sun had vanished like some one
who disappears, like a judge who leaves his
court. Then these ingrates knew the
beauty of Amaterasu. How they searched
in the drear air! A great sigh ran through
all the islands,—the agony of penitence,
the abomination of fear. As in the evening
the mosquitoes in myriads fill the stagnant
air, the earth was delivered to the brigandage
of demons, and of the dead whom
one could recognize by this sign: that they
had no navels. As a pilot covers his nearest
lights, the better to see into the distance;
so, by the suppression of this central lamp,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
space widened around them. And, from a
part of the horizon unseen before, they saw
a strange whiteness beyond the sky, like
the frontier of a neighboring world: the
reflection of another sun.</p>

<p>Then all the gods and goddesses, the
familiar spirits of the earth, which assist
Man and are his companions like horses
and oxen,—all were moved by the miserable
cries of the hairless creatures, like the
barking of little dogs; and they all assembled
at the mouth of the river Yokigawa,
spirits both of the sea and of the air,—like
herds of buffalo, like schools of herring,
like flocks of starlings. There the
virgin Amaterasu was hidden in a cave in
the earth, like a honeycomb in the hollow
of a tree, like a treasure in a jug.</p>

<p>“A lamp is not extinguished except by
a more brilliant light,” they said. “Amaterasu
is there! We do not see her, but we
know that she has not left us. Her glory
has not suffered diminution. She is hidden
in the earth like a cricket, like an ascetic
in the retreat of his own thoughts. How
shall we make her come out? What appeal
can we make to her, and what can we offer
her that will be as beautiful as she?”</p>

<p>Then from a stone fallen from heaven
they made a mirror, very pure, completely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
round. They tore down a pine-tree and
swathed it in garments of gold and scarlet,
like a doll. They adorned it like a woman,
and they put the mirror upon it for a face.
And they placed this sacred <em>gohei</em> exactly in
front of the cavern, which contained the
indignant soul of light.</p>

<p>What voice could they choose powerful
enough to pierce the earth, to say, “Amaterasu,
I am here! I am here, and I know
that you are here also! Show yourself to me,
oh vision of my eyes! Oh Life, come out
of the sepulcher!” The familiar voice, the
first voice that she hears when she passes
the horizon of human life: the cock calling
from the farms on every side at the first
crimson streak of dawn,—his is the cry of
light itself, the trumpet that no obscurity
can stifle! Night or day, indifferent to
the visible presence of his goddess or to
her withdrawal, indefatigably he carries
on his fanfare, with precision he articulates
his faith. So before the buried Amaterasu
they led the great white bird. And he
crowed. And, having crowed, he crowed
again.</p>

<p>Then, as if they could not fail to respond
to his summons, all the noises of life awoke:
the murmur of the day; active, interminable
speech; the sound of thousands<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
thronging the hours; the vibrating word
whose rhythm is meted out by the bonze
with his mallet of wood in the depth of his
temple. All these sounded at once,—all
the gods, responding to their names. They
were very timid, very faint. However
Amaterasu in the earth heard them, and
was astonished.</p>

<p>And here one must insert the image of
Uzumé, just as, in the little popular books,
her picture interrupts the black shower
of letters. She had invented all this, the
dear goddess. She had concocted this
wonderful strategy. And now she danced
intrepidly on the stretched skin of her drum,
frantic with hope; and all that she could
find to lure out the sun was a poor little
song invented for children: <em>Hito futa
miyo....</em></p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<p><em>Hito futa miyo<br>
Itsu muyu nana<br>
Yokokono tari<br>
Momochi yorodzu</em>,</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>as one might say: <em>One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten, a hundred, a
thousand, ten thousand!</em>—and as if one said
also: <em>All of you, look at the door! Her
Majesty has appeared. Hurrah! Our hearts
are filled with happiness.</em></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span></p>

<p>Then in the fury of the dance she untied
her belt, she threw it impatiently aside;
and, with draperies flowing, laughing and
crying, she stamped and bounded on the
elastic and resonant skin which she struck
sharply with her feet. And, when they saw
her robust and buxom form like that of a
little girl, relief came into the hearts of all
and they began to laugh. <em>The sun is no
longer in the sky, and still there are not
lamentations, but laughter?</em> Amaterasu
heard them, and her heart was filled with
chagrin. Unable to conquer her curiosity,
she softly opened the door of the cavern:
“<em>Why are you laughing?</em>”</p>

<p>A great ray swept across the assembled
gods; it leaped the border of the earth;
it illumined the moon in the empty sky.
Suddenly the Day-Star flamed in the lifeless
heavens. As an overripe fruit bursts, behold!—the
blind earth could no longer
contain the jealous eye, the burning fire of
curiosity placed in its center, the woman
who is the sun! “Why are you laughing?”—“Oh
Amaterasu!” said Uzumé.</p>

<p>And all the gods in unison cried, “Oh
Amaterasu!” prostrating themselves.</p>

<p>“Oh Amaterasu, you were not with us;
you thought you had withdrawn your face
from us; but look, here is some one more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
beautiful than you are! <em>Look!</em>” she said,
showing the <em>gohei</em>, showing the sacred mirror
which, concentrating the flame, produced
an insupportable brilliance. “<em>Look!</em>”</p>

<p>She saw; and, jealous, raptured, astonished,
fascinated, she took one step out of
the cavern; and instantly the night was
gone!</p>

<p>All the great worlds, that turn about the
sun as an eagle circles his prey, were astonished
to see the day shining in such an
unaccustomed place and the little earth
all devoured with glory, like a chandelier
which disappears in its own light.</p>

<p>She took one step out of the cavern, and
immediately the strongest of the gods leaped
forward to close the door behind her.
Before her image, surrounded by seven
rainbows,—adorable spirit, living fire, from
which, with the divine face, emerged only
two hands, two pink feet, and the curls
of her hair,—so young, so formidable
stood this brilliant and essential soul!
And, like the swallow which lifts itself in
larger and larger circles above the sparkling
fields, so Amaterasu, reconquered by
her own image, mounted toward her celestial
throne. And Time began again with
its first day!</p>

<p>At the doorway of the Shinto temples,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
by means of a cord of straw, the earth still
guards against the disappearance of its
light; and, in the last recess of the bare
sanctuary, they hide, instead of the Eleusinian
fire, a little round mirror of polished
metal.</p>



<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak" >A VISIT</h2>
</div>


<p>There are long cries before any one
opens,—furious batterings upon the
patient portal,—before the servant, grown
conscious of this “concert,” comes to recognize
the stranger deposited on a litter
in the midst of his porters, before the door.
For here there is no deep-sounding bell,
no button which, by the pulling of a wire
attached through the walls to secret mechanism,
sets off a sudden explosion, like the
squeal of a beast that one pinches. The
Black Mountain is the quarter where the
old families live, and the silence is profound.
The space that Europeans would reserve
for recreation and games, the Chinese consecrate
to retreat. In this animal honeycomb,
between these streets seething with
an unclean humanity, they reserve wide
unused spaces,—empty enclosures that are
the inheritance of some distinguished person,
and that cloister his household gods. Only
a noble roof can possess the enormous
shade of these banyans older than the city,
and of these vines which droop under the
weight of their purple globes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span></p>

<p>I have entered. I am waiting all alone in
the little parlor. It is four o’clock, and the
rain has ceased,—or is it still raining?
The earth has received its fill of water;
the soaked leaves breathe freely. As for
me, under this somber and friendly sky
I know the compunction and peace which
one feels after having wept. Facing me is
a wall with an uneven coping, where three
square windows open, each crossed with
porcelain bars imitating bamboo. As they
adjust a “grille” over diplomatic papers,
which isolates the important words, so they
have applied this screen of triple openings
to the wide countryside of trees and water,
and have reduced it to a single theme
repeated as in a triptych. The frame
defines the picture; the bars, which let my
sight pass, exclude me, and, better than a
closed and bolted door, make certain that
I remain inside.</p>

<p>My host does not arrive. I am alone.</p>



<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" >THE RICE</h2>
</div>


<p>It is our very teeth that we sink in the
earth, in this plow that we plant there;
and even now our bread eats there as we
shall eat. At home, in the cold north, it
is the sun who kneads our bread; he ripens
the field as the open fire cooks our pancakes
and roasts our meat. With a strong plowshare
we open a furrow in the solid earth
where that crust of bread is formed which we
cut with our knife and grind between our
teeth.</p>

<p>But here the sun does not serve only to
heat the domestic sky like a furnace full
of coals. One must take precautions with
it. When the year commences, the waters
overflow. These vast fields without slopes,
scarcely separated from the sea that they
continue, that the rain soaks without ever
draining away, take refuge under the sheet of
water in which the peasants fix a thousand
rice-frames. The work of the village is
to enrich the mud by means of many
buckets; on all fours the farmer strokes
the mud and dilutes it with his hands.
The Mongol does not nibble bread, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
snatches it with his lips, he gulps it down,
without fashioning a semi-liquid aliment
of it in his mouth. So the rice grows, as
it is cooked, in steam; and the intention of
its people is to furnish all the water it will
need to sustain the heat of the celestial
furnace. Also, when the waters rise, the
chain-pumps sing like crickets everywhere;
and they do not have recourse to the buffalo.
Side by side, clinging to the same bar
and pressing the red handle with knees in
unison, men and women watch the kitchen
of their field as a housewife watches a smoking
dinner. And the Annamite carries the
water in a sort of spoon; in his black soutane,
with his little tortoise head, as yellow
as mustard, he is the weary sacristan of
the mire. How many reverences and genuflections
there are when, with a bucket
fastened to two cords, the pair of <em>nhaques</em>
go seeking in all the hollows for juicy mud
with which to anoint the earth and make
it good to eat.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" >THE PERIOD</h2>
</div>


<p>I stop. There is a period to my walk
as to a phrase that is finished. It is
the title of a tomb at my feet, at this turning
where the road descends. From there
I take my last view of the earth. I survey
the country of the dead. With its groups
of pines and olive trees, it spreads out
between the deep fields that enclose it.
Everywhere there is consummate plenty:
Ceres has embraced Persephone. Inescapably
this marks the ultimate. I recognize
at the foot of these unchangeable mountains
the wide line of the river. I define
our frontier, I accept it. My exile is symbolized
by this island crowded with the
dead, devoured by its harvests. Standing
alone amid a buried people, my feet
among the names spoken by the grass,
I watch this cleft in the mountains, through
which the soft wind, like a growling dog,
has tried for two days to force the enormous
cloud it has drawn from the waters
behind me.</p>

<p>It is done; the day is completely gone.
There is nothing left but to return, traversing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
again the road that leads me to
the house. At this halt, where rest the
carriers of coffins and buckets, I look behind
me for a long time at the yellow road where
the living fare with the dead, which ends
like a red period upon the crowded sky.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" >THE TOAST TO A FUTURE DAY</h2>

<p>I have climbed to the highest point of
the mountain to drink a toast to a future
day,—to a new day, to one that will come,—perhaps
it will succeed this very night.
<em>To the highest point of the mountain, in this
cup of ice that it lifts to the very lips of Aurora!</em>
I have stripped and rushed into it. It
is so full that, when I enter, the water
overflows like a cataract. I dance in the
ebullition of the source like a grape-seed in
a glass of champagne. I cannot distinguish
this gushing basin in which I splash from
the whirlpool of air separated from me by
a narrow brink. Far below me circles the
clamorous eagle. Beautiful Aurora, like a
shaft thou art sped here from the sea below
among the islands! Drink! that I may
feel the quivering of thy insatiate lip as
deep as the submerged plants to which I
sink. Let the sun rise! that I may see the
light shadow of my suspended body painted
beneath me on the sand of this basin ringed
with the seven-colored rainbow.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" >THE DAY OF THE FEAST OF ALL<br>
THE RIVERS</h2>
</div>


<p>On this day of the feast of all the rivers
we are going to salute our own, which
is wide and rapid. It is the outlet of the
country, it is the force enclosed in her sides,
it is the liquefaction of the substance of the
earth, it is the outpouring of the water
hidden in the most secret of her folds, of
milk under the impulsion of the ocean
which suckles her. Here, under the good
old granite bridge; between the boats from
the mountain which bring us minerals and
sugar, and, on the other side, the many-colored
junks of the sea, which from their
anchorage direct toward the impassive piles
their great patient eyes, like those of beasts
of burden; the river pours out through sixty
arches. What an uproar, what a white
foam it makes, when Aurora sounds her
trumpet,—when the Evening recedes, to
the beating of drums. Here are no piers
like those dreary egresses of the Occident.
On a level with the river, in a domestic
familiarity, each one comes to wash linen,
to draw the water for supper. And, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
the Springtime, in the turbulence of his joy,
this dragon with undulant coils invades
our streets and our houses. He effaces
with one lick of his tongue the accumulated
filth of the village.</p>

<p>But today is the feast of the river. We
celebrate carnival with it, in the rolling
tumult of yellow waters. If you cannot
pass the day in a backwater, sunk to the
eyes like a buffalo in the shade of your boat,
at least do not neglect to offer to the sun
of noon pure water in a bowl of white porcelain.
For the coming year it will be a certain
remedy against colic. And this is
not the time to be avaricious. One may
unseal the heaviest jug, drink from a golden
bowl or earthenware vessel, one may drink
from the very neck of the bottle the tea of
the Fourth Month! Let every one, on this
afternoon of flood-tide and full sunlight,
come to feel, to stroke, to clasp, to ride this
great municipal water-beast, which flees
with endless coils toward the sea.</p>

<p>Moving throughout its length, trembling
from bank to bank with sampans and with
boats; where the guests, clothed in silk
like vivid bouquets, drink and enjoy themselves;
all is light and the sound of drums.
From here, from there, from everywhere,
pirogues with dragons’ heads appear and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
defile, propelled by the arms of an hundred
naked paddlers, who move to the delirious
rhythm of this large yellow man in the midst,
as with both hands he beats out a demoniac
march. How close together they seem,—in
one wave, the very spirit of the current!
How active this crowd of bodies,
plunged to the waist! On the bank where
I embark a woman is washing her linen.
The bowl of vermilion lacquer into which
piles the clothing has a border of gold
that shines and glows in the sun of this
festival. Brute glance of reflected brightness;
symbolic eye of this day of the
honorable River!</p>



<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" >THE GOLDEN HOUR</h2>
</div>


<p>Of all the year this is the most golden
hour! As the farmer at the end of
the season realizes the fruits of his labors
and receives their price, so the season
comes in a gold to which all is transmuted,
in the sky and on the earth. I wander
through the lanes of the harvest, up to the
neck in gold; I rest my chin on the table
of the field which flashes in the sunlight to
its farthest boundary. Going toward the
mountains, I surmount a sea of grain.
Between the banks of harvest, the immense,
dry flame of the morning-colored
plain, where is the old dim earth? Water
is changed into wine; oranges gleam in
the silent branches. All is ripe; grain and
straw, and the fruit with the leaf. It is
indeed golden. All is finished, and I see
that all is true. In the fervent effort of
the year all color has evaporated. Suddenly,
to my eyes, the earth is like a sun.
Let me not die before the golden hour!</p>



<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" >DISSOLUTION</h2>
</div>


<p>Again I am carried back over the indifferent
liquid sea. When I am dead,
nothing can hurt me. When I shall be
interred between my father and mother,
nothing will make me suffer more. They
cannot jeer any longer at this too ardent
heart. The sacrament of my body will
dissolve in the interior of the earth; but, like
a most piercing cry, my soul will repose
in the bosom of Abraham. Now everything
is dissolved, and with a dull and heavy eye
I search about me in vain for the familiar
land and the firm road under my feet,—and
for that unkind face! The sky is nothing
but fog, and Space is nothing but water!
You see it! Everything is blurred; and
all about me I must search in vain for line
or form. For a horizon there is nothing
but the cessation of color in darkness.
All matter is resolved into water alone,
like the tears I feel coursing down my
cheeks. All sound is like the murmur
of sleep when it breathes to us all that is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
most crushing to our hopes. I shall have
searched in vain, I shall find nothing more
beyond me—neither that country which
might have been my home, nor that
well-loved face!</p>

electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
